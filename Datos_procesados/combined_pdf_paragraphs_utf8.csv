In this paper, we analyze the response of European and global  stock markets alongside a representative sample of commodities. We compare the war response against the  recent Covid-19 pandemic and the not-too-distant 2008 global financial crisis. Applying a Markov-switching  HAR model on volatility proxies, estimates are made of synchronization, duration and intensity measures for  each event. In broad terms, stock markets and commodities respond most rapidly to the Russian invasion; and  post-invasion crisis intensity is noticeably smaller compared to both the Covid-19 and the GFC. Wheat and nickel  are the most affected commodities due to the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"1. Introduction  On February 24, 2022 Russia invaded the Ukraine. Moscow's MOEX  index dropped almost 9% in the week following the invasion (Financial  Times, 2022d). Stock market indices also registered significant losses, as  Fig. 1 shows. Far-reaching effects in Europe, and possibly the world, are  only beginning to unfold. Supply chain disruptions amplify the upsurge  in commodity prices, while a massive refugee influx unfolds with almost  7 million Ukrainians escaping their country.1  The economic sanctions imposed in the US, Europe and elsewhere  suggest that Russia's economy will contract significantly (Pestova,  Mamonov, & Ongena, 2022). Rising energy revenues are unlikely to  counteract the economic repercussions of the global pull out from  Russia. This may prove the greatest hit to the global economy since the  Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008; and it may exceed the impact of  Covid-19 given the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"Countries in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa import  75% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine (World Bank, 2022b)."
"Ukraine's exports of seed oil account for 40% of global exports. Over  13% of corn exports and 5% of wheat exports come from Ukraine. Russia  accounts for 25% of global natural gas exports, 18% of coal exports, 11%  of crude oil exports, 18% of wheat exports and 14% of fertilizers (World  Bank, 2022b). With countries still in a recovery phase from Covid-19,  the after-effects of the Russian invasion are likely to have a com pounding effect financially. In the aftermath of Covid, forecasts indi cated GDP growth of 3.9%; this has been revised to 3.6% (Financial  Times, 2022b). Inflation was expected to rise by 7.5% in 2022 (European  Commission, 2021). However, the impact on inflation will depend on  monetary policy response and is yet to be realised."
"Following the invasion, several studies examined the impact of  sanctions (Berner, Cecchetti, & Schoenholtz, 2022) on global financial  markets (Deng, Leippold, Wagner, & Wang, 2022; Huang & Lu, 2022);  We would like to thank the editor (Brian Lucey) and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful suggestions.

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 2 on macroeconomic risks within the Euro area (Ferrara, Mogliani, &  Sahuc, 2022); and on the international monetary system (Brunnermeier  et al., 2022). However, sanctions are variable across countries, business  sectors and corporations.2 Thus in this paper, we strategically steer away  from the sanctions-based literature and examine the impact of the  Russian-Ukrainian war on financial market volatility. We obtain and  analyse estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity of stock  markets and representative commodities for various segments (i.e., en ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We also draw  comparisons with the impact of the 2008 GFC and the Covid-19  pandemic. These three events constitute the main shocks to the global  economy over the past fifteen years. For our research design we employ  a Markov-switching HAR model on daily volatility proxies around each  crisis. This allows for endogenously identified regime shifts upon which  basis we compute metrics for the synchronization, duration, and in tensity of each crisis."
"The paper contributes to the fast-emerging literature on the impact of  the Russian-Ukrainian war upon economic and financial outcomes. Our  results show an instantaneous reaction of world stock markets to the  Russian-Ukrainian war. This suggests that the invasion was interpreted  as real news by investors. The timeliness of the response is unlike that  of either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where a lag of up to seven days  is evidenced. The crisis duration metrics, however, suggest that the  severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has been muted compared to  either the GFC or the Covid-19. We attribute this to an expectation that  the war would not be prolonged. Moreover, it is possible that investors  mis-interpret this event. Past war-like experiences have been markedly  different; they have primarily involved one-off terrorist attacks, have  been beyond the European continent, and were not met by widespread  sanctions. Thereby investors may have been falsely drawing insights  from such prior experiences. Commodity insights concur with the stock  markets in all but one aspect: intensity. Despite average intensity values  being comparable to both the GFC and the Covid-19, specific com modities (e.g., wheat, nickel, lead) reveal strong ongoing pressure in this  asset class following the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis. Given the stra tegic importance to the economy of the affected commodities implica tions on inflation and supply chain are yet to unfold."
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the  relevant literature. Section 3 presents a synopsis of the data and the  methodology. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings.
Robustness analysis is presented in section 5. A final section concludes.
"2. Background information  2.1. Volatility and global financial markets  Volatility is important for analysing risk in financial markets; how ever, it is not directly observable. The increased availability of intraday  data has shifted attention to realised measures for volatility modelling."
"Realised volatility (RV) has been shown to dominate several parametric  approximations, including GARCH-type and stochastic volatility (SV)  models (Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, & Labys, 2003). Volatility is  highly persistent, and the flexible and easy-to-estimate heterogeneous  autoregressive (HAR) (Corsi, 2009) has emerged as a modelling work horse (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev, Li, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2020;  Bollerslev, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2018). That volatility is affected by  Fig. 1. Major stock market indices response following the Russian-Ukrainian invasion."

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 3 economic shocks is well-known. To capture structural breaks a variety of  transition models may be embedded within the HAR framework.3 For  example, Izzeldin, Murado glu, Pappas, and Sivaprasad (2021) utilize a  smooth-transition HAR (ST-HAR) to identify intensity, timeliness, and  homogeneity of the Covid-19 crisis upon G7 stock markets. Parametric  models of volatility estimation can also allow for similar dynamics, see  for example Pappas, Ingham, Izzeldin, and Steele (2016) who use a  Markov-switching multivariate DCC-GARCH model to examine the  synchronicity of the GFC crisis upon European stock markets. Yip,  Brooks, Do, and Nguyen (2020) examine the volatility spill-over effects  between oil and agricultural products using a Markov-switching setup."
"2.2. Global financial markets and geopolitical events  In Fig. 2 we compare the volatility reaction of financial markets to  major geopolitical and key historical events over the last century. Using  the S&P 500 index due to its long data availability, we calculate two  volatility proxies, namely the realised volatility as the sum of squared  returns over the past 22 trading days, and the conditional volatility  estimated from a GARCH(1,1) model. In addition, we plot Economic  Policy Uncertainty (EPU), which is a news-based indicator, and the  historical Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRH), which gauges adverse  geopolitical events and related risks obtained from a variety of news-  based outlets.4  Financial markets respond to a wide array of geopolitical events. The  sample under consideration contains wars, invasions, terrorist attacks  and periods of tension. A cursory inspection finds the response of global  financial markets to the Russian-Ukrainian war to be relatively muted  compared to other financial crises (e.g., the 2008 Lehman collapse, the  1987 Black Monday, and the Covid-19). However, it is more pronounced  than that of several terrorist attacks (but not the 9/11) and other in stances of war or invasions."
"Though wars generally have a strong impact on financial markets,  the relevant literature is limited. Not surprisingly, Wisniewski (2016)  finds that wars result in widespread destruction of human and physical  capital and stock markets fall. Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2011)  investigate 447 international political crises  but not all are wars. They  find that the global stock market returns would have been higher by  3.6% per annum but for these events. Hudson and Urquhart (2015)  study the effect of the second world war (WWII, thereafter) on the  British stock market and find that only one of the wartime events clas sified as important resulted in a structural break. Frey and Kucher  (2000) examine the prices of the government bonds of five European  countries during WWII. They find that the loss and gain of national  sovereignty affected the bond prices of the countries. Frey and Kucher  (2001) analyse government bond prices of Germany and Austria traded  on the Swiss bourse during WWII. They show that war episodes are  clearly reflected in government bond prices. Brown Jr and Burdekin  (2002) study German bonds traded on the London stock exchange  Great Crash Great Depression Poland invasion France invasion Pearl Harbor Iron Curtain SKorea invastion Suez crisis Cuban crisis JFK assassination Gulf of Tonkin Six-day war Penn Central bankruptcy Munich Olympics Yom Kippur War Nixon resigns Reagan shooting Cont'l bailout Black Monday Kuwait invasion Soros FWTC bombing Asian crisis Yemen bombing 9/11 Iraq war Madrid bomb London bomb Bear Stearn Lehman collapse Boston bomb Crimea Paris bomb Brexit Syria war Covid-19 Ukraine invasion 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1928 1934 1941 1948 1954 1961 1968 1974 1981 1988 1994 2001 2008 2014 2021 Volatility H R P G , U P E EPU GPRH Realised Volatility Conditional Volatility Fig. 2.

"Notes: We use the S&P 500 returns to calculate: i) realised volatility, as the sum of squared returns over the past 22 trading days; ii) conditional volatility, based on a  GARCH(1,1) model. The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is a news-based indicator of economic uncertainty and is available from 1985 onwards. GPRH is the  historical geopolitical risk index."
"3 A variety of transition models have been used that typically can be classified  according to the nature dynamics they introduce (i.e., discrete, or smooth), the  break identification (i.e., exogenous or endogenous) and the number of breaks  and regimes allowed. We direct you to Hamilton (1989) and Tsay (2005) for an  in-depth discussion."
"4 Due to data limitations EPU data are available from 1985 onwards, see  Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for details. Caldara and Iacoviello (2022)  construct the geopolitical risk index, which is available here. We use the his torical version for its extended coverage. The index is available here:  https://www.matteoiacoviello.com/gpr.htm  M. Izzeldin et al."
International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 4 during WWII and document a negative impact on only two events during  the entire conflict course. Waldenstr om and Frey (2008) observe sudden  shifts in sovereign debt yields and spreads in the Nordic bond markets  during WWII. Frey and Waldenstr om (2004) compare sovereign debt  prices on the Zurich and Stockholm stock exchanges and conclude that  market efficiency has not been affected by WWII.
"Some studies examine the impact of US military engagements upon  financial markets. Leigh, Wolfers, and Zitzewitz (2003) analyse financial  market data to assess the economic consequences of the war with Iraq."
"They find that net oil importers are most likely to experience adverse  effects from the war. Also in respect of Iraq, Rigobon and Sack (2005)  find that war risk is associated with declines in Treasury bond yields and  equity prices. Amihud and Wohl (2004) find that the Iraqi war is asso ciated with rising stock prices. Perhaps an increasing probability that  Saddam Hussein would be deposed was interpreted as good news by  stock market investors. Choudhry (2010) apply a structural break test to  investigate the structural shifts in returns and volatility and determine  whether such shifts are associated with the events of WWII. Omar,  Wisniewski, and Nolte (2017) analyse the impact of 64 instances of se vere international crisis and classify 43 events as the war sample."
Their event window starts 50 trading days before the outbreak of war  and ends 50 trading days thereafter. They find that returns were  3.47% for the World stock market index and 4.67% for S&P 500.
"Wisniewski (2009) examine the impact of WWII, the Korean war and  other US military engagements and provide evidence of how these  events are negatively related to the market value of stocks. Based on the  discussion above, we conclude that the impact of wars on stock markets  and other asset classes is detrimental."
"2.3. Covid-19 and global financial markets  The novel corona virus (COVID-19) was first detected in China in  December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a  pandemic in the following mid-March. The response across financial  markets was dire. In a month, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 fell by  35% and the volatility of the financial markets was comparable to the  2008 GFC (Baker et al., 2020). To curtail the spread rate, governments  introduced widespread lockdown measures that impeded global eco nomic activity. Business sectors and countries were affected; relatedly  Izzeldin et al. (2021) find adverse effects on all sectors but for the  Technology firms, which weathered the pandemic better. Sergi, Harjoto,  Rossi, and Lee (2021) show that economic outcomes, as tracked by the  Barro Misery Index (BMI), are driven by the Covid-19 related cases and  deaths, and are reflected on stock market return volatility. Benkraiem,  Garfatta, Lakhal, and Zorgati (2022) conclude that financial contagion is  more intense in America than in Asia."
"3. Data and methodology  3.1. Data  We examine global financial market reactions in three crises events,  namely the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and  the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. For each event, we use the [3,3]  months estimation window using daily data.5 Our choice of the bench mark date (t = 0) on each occasion is: i) the Lehman Brothers collapse on  15/9/2008; ii) the announcement of Italy's lockdown on 9/3/2020; iii)  the invasion day on 24/2/2022, respectively.6  Volatility data for the stock markets comprise the realised variance  for a selection of global stock markets obtained from the OxfordMan  institute realised library.7 Realised variance (RV) is calculated as the sum  of squared intraday returns (Andersen et al., 2003; Andersen, Bollerslev,  Table 1  Descriptive statistics  stock markets."

Mean volatility is expressed in annualized percentage terms.
Range is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values. GFC refers to the 2008 global financial crisis; WAR to the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian war.
Realised measures are not available for Italy and Portugal during the GFC period.
"5 Our window length choice is consistent with Omar et al. (2017). As  robustness we also use a larger window [6,6] months for the 2008 GFC and  the Covid-19 crisis and the results remain qualitatively similar. Thus, we retain  our [3,3] specification for consistency purposes across the three events."
6 For the Covid-19 event benchmark date we concur with the Nozawa and  Qiu (2021) study.
7 The realised measures are obtained from the Oxford Man Institute of  Quantitative Finance database here: https://www.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/o  ur-research/realized-library/  M. Izzeldin et al.
"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 5 Diebold, & Ebens, 2001; Barndorff-Nielsen & Shephard, 2002) as:  RVt =  K j=1 r2 t,j (1)   where j subscripts each of the K equally spaced 5-min subintervals in  each day. We compute the realised volatility and express it in percentage  annualized format for the rest of the analysis."
"Volatility data for the commodities are not available via the realised  library. Hence, we resort to conditional parametric volatility estimators  of the GARCH family. Specifically, consider a T  1 vector of demeaned  asset returns rt, the conditional variance is estimated as a GARCH(1,1)  process:  rtF t1 N ( 0, h2 t ) (2)   h2 t =  + au2 t1 + br2 t1 (3)  Subsequently we compute the conditional volatility and express it in  percentage annualized format for the rest of the analysis."
"Table 1 presents key descriptive statistics for the realised volatility  across the sampled countries for the three crisis periods under exami nation. Brazil, Norway and Denmark emerge as the countries with the  highest average realised volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-  Ukrainian war crises respectively. By contrast, Singapore exhibits the  lowest average realised volatility during the GFC and war periods, and  the second lowest during the Covid-19."
Table 2 presents key descriptive statistics for the conditional vola tility of commodities over the three periods of crisis under examination.
"Lead, oil and natural gas are the commodities with the highest average  conditional volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war  periods respectively. By contrast, gold exhibits the lowest average con ditional volatility during the GFC and Russian-Ukrainian war periods."
Soyabean shows the lowest conditional volatility during the Covid-19.
"3.2. Methodology  Modelling realised measures has relied extensively on the hetero geneous autoregressive model (HAR) (Corsi, 2009). The superior per formance of the HAR in modelling and forecasting realised volatility is  well-established (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev et al., 2020; Bollerslev,  Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2016). Compared to ARFIMA, estimation and  forecasting are more easily obtained from HAR models. Following Corsi  (2009) the HAR model is defined as:  ht = c + (d)ht1 + (w)h(w) t + (m)h(m) t + et (4)   where et~iid(0,2) with ht (w) and ht (m) defined as follows:  h(w) t = 1 5 (ht1 + ht2 + ht3 + ht4 + ht5) (5)   h(m) t = 1 22 (ht1 + ht2 +  + ht21 + ht22) (6)  To allow for non-linear dynamics in the volatility process we allow  for a Markov-switching structure. Markov-switching models have been  used in conjunction with the GARCH family of models for similar pur poses in Pappas et al. (2016). By contrast, Izzeldin et al. (2021) use a  smooth transition variant of the HAR to accommodate crisis periods."
"Contrary to smooth-transition models, Markov-switching allows for a  discrete shift in the regime, which is more appropriate for our setup  where we compare financial market volatility during the three crises.8  Markov-switching models utilize a latent state variable (st = m) to  denote the state m of the economy in period t, with m = 1, , M. By  construction, a Markov-switching model estimates the transition prob ability from the data. To allow for more realistic dynamics during each  of the turmoil periods, we assume that the HAR parameters related to  the weekly and monthly volatility are regime invariant.

The threshold  line is centred at each crisis date, with the graph showing the pre- and  post-three-month evolution window. A cursory inspection finds the  response during the Covid-19 to be more pronounced than the GFC and  the Russian-Ukrainian war events."
"Table 3 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea sures for each of the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war crises. In  each table, we report the median for each country and the median values  for key country groupings namely the G7 economies, the European  countries, and the rest of the world (RoW). Next, we discuss these results  by measure focusing on Europe. Crisis synchronization median values  suggest an instantaneous reaction of stock markets to the invasion news."
"This is observed for the Europe group, but also for the G7 and the RoW  groups. The timeliness of the response is unlike those pertaining to the  GFC or Covid-19 events. In the GFC crisis, synchronization show Europe  to respond with a 4-day lag, and the G7 taking the longest at seven days."
"During the Covid-19, Europe responds at a 1-day lag; yet G7 and RoW  take longer."
"Coming now to discuss percentage duration, we find Europe values at  7.25%, suggesting that stock markets spent a significantly shorter period  in the crisis regime compared to the GFC, and the Covid-19. A similar  result is observed for the RoW countries. We discuss intensity values  next. Our results show that crisis intensity for Europe following the  Russian-Ukrainian war stands at 89.89%, significantly higher than  either the GFC (at 73.76%) or the Covid-19 (at 82.16%). The G7 and  RoW values during the Russian-Ukrainian war are 69.08% and 71.31%  respectively. Interestingly, these values are lower for the G7 group  compared to both the GFC and the Covid-19 (77.67% and 86.70%  respectively), however they are comparable across all crises for the RoW  group."
In summary our analysis of the stock markets here suggests that their  volatility response to the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis has been instan taneous. This is unlike the GFC or Covid-19 where a certain lag was  observed. We believe that the instantaneous reaction of stock markets  shows that the invasion was interpreted as real news by investors.
"Despite the prolonged summoning of Russian forces at the Ukrainian  borders, an actual invasion had not been discounted by the markets and  was considered unlikely, until it materialized. The crisis intensity,  however, suggests that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has  been, on a global scale, muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid-  19. We find this puzzling given the severity of such an incident. It is  plausible that investors mis-interpret this event. Past warlike experi ences have been markedly different in the sense that they involve mainly  one-off terrorist attacks and/or have been away from the European  continent. Thereby investors may be falsely drawing insights from such  prior experiences and underestimating the real implications of the  Russian-Ukrainian war (Financial Times, 2022e; The Guardian, 2022b)."
"However, as Russia's aggression in Ukraine remains unabated, the world  seems to embrace that the transition into a long-term conflict appears a  likely scenario (BBC, 2022; Financial Times, 2022a). Besides, the pro longed conflict has even led banks to downgrade their growth forecasts  (JP Morgan, 2022)."

A  cursory inspection of the graphs shows that commodities are affected in  a comparable way across the three crisis events. Furthermore, the nature  of each crisis appears to be particularly relevant for specific commod ities. Base materials such as copper and nickel are more affected  following the GFC, whereas oil is more affected following the Covid-19  crisis.

"Table 4 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea sures for all commodities in our sample. In addition, we report median  values for all commodities and for each commodity segment (i.e., en ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We discuss  synchronization, duration and intensity measures in turn, starting by the  overall commodity measures and then focusing on the specific com modity segments. Crisis synchronization median values suggest that  commodities respond with a 2-day lag after the invasion materialized;  this is earlier than either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises. The early  response of commodities is largely driven by the precious metals and  base materials that have reacted faster. Agricultural commodities  responded with a 2-day lag, which is comparable to the GFC crisis re sults. By contrast, the agricultural commodities reacted latest in the  Covid-19 crisis, with a 17-day lag."
"We now proceed to discuss percentage duration values. During the  Russian-Ukrainian war, the median duration has been at 6.42%,  significantly lower than either the GFC (at 6.81%) or Covid-19 (at  7.38%) crises. High duration values are evidenced for precious and base  metals. Agricultural commodities show approximately two times higher  median duration value during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to  the Covid-19."

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 10 Commodity intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been at  23.65%, which is similar to the other two crises. However, this aggre gate result masks the heterogeneity across commodity segments. Spe cifically, crisis intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been the  highest for the base materials (at 38.26%) and lowest for the precious  metals (at 18.36%). Within the agricultural commodities, with an in tensity value of 48.87%, wheat is the most severely affected. The high  crisis intensity value for wheat may be partially explained by the un certainty over Ukraine and Russia, both within the largest exporters  worldwide, being able to meet world demand (FAO, 2022). Nickel has  been the most severely affected commodity with an intensity value at  116.65%. This is largely explained by the sanctions over Russia, a top-3  nickel exporter, in conjunction with rising demand that is associated  with its use in electric vehicles (Daniel, 2022)."

Still, the  particularly high duration and intensity values for specific commodities  reflect the strong ongoing pressure on commodities and have been  highlighted as a cause for concern. In particular, a stressed commodity  market could have several ramifications, such as triggering food crises to  putting pressure on the derivative trading platforms (Financial Times,  2022e)."
"5. Robustness  In the main analysis the transition between volatility regimes has  been discrete and modelled via a Markov-switching HAR model. We  perform a robustness check using a smooth transition specification,  which allows for an analogue-like transition between regimes.10 Com mon in both specifications is the endogenous identification of the  transition between the regimes. In the smooth transition HAR (ST-HAR)  model the transition between two regimes is governed by the expo nential function, see Izzeldin et al. (2021) for more details. Of the HAR  parameters, we assume the constant and the daily component to be  regime dependent, while weekly and monthly volatility components are  regime invariant. The following equation is estimated via nonlinear least  square techniques and Newey-West robust standard errors:  ht = 0 + (d)ht1 + (w)h(w) t + (m)h(m) t + ( 0 + (d)ht1 )  ( 1 exp (  / 2 st(st )2 ) ) + et (13)   where st is a threshold variable with unknown threshold () and slope  () values; 0, 0 and (d), (d) are the threshold coefficients for the  constant and the daily component respectively; t is the stochastic error  term. The threshold coefficient () gauges the synchronicity of the  transition, with high (low) values indicating a lag (lead) in the transi tion. The slope coefficient may be interpreted as the transition speed  between regimes, with high (low) values giving evidence towards an  abrupt (gradual) shift."
"Table 5 presents the median estimated slope and threshold param eters of the ST-HAR model for the stock markets (Panel A) and com modities (Panel B). Based on their estimated values we compare the  transition patterns across regimes for each crisis.11  As compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19 crisis, the lower  threshold coefficient value during the Russian-Ukrainian war indicates  the earlier response of the global stock markets (see Panel A) and  commodities (see Panel B) to the event. Thus, it corroborates the main  findings of the paper."
"The slope coefficient is the highest for the G7 stock markets during  the Russian-Ukrainian war (7.78) suggesting an abrupt regime change,  more pronounced than either the Covid-19 (6.14) or the GFC (2.23). The  fact that European stock markets respond in a smoother fashion to the  Russian-Ukrainian war compared to the Covid-19 (1.55 vs 9.26) sub stantiates further our main finding that investors may be falsely  assessing the severity and the duration of the event."
"Similar to global stock markets, commodities record the largest slope  coefficient during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to either of the  GFC or Covid-19 crisis. The abrupt transition is mainly driven by agri cultural commodities (e.g., wheat) and base materials (e.g., nickel), a  result that is consistent with the main analysis. Interestingly, precious  materials show a more muted response compared to past crises."

International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 12 markets. We analyse the volatility response of European and global stock  markets and a representative sample of commodities to the war crisis  and compare it against the recent Covid-19 pandemic and the 2008  global financial crisis.
"This study employs a Markov-switching HAR model on volatility  proxies and obtains estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity  for each crisis event. The Markov-switching HAR model allows for an  endogenously identified regime shift."
"Our results show an instantaneous reaction of global stock markets to  the Russian-Ukrainian war, which suggests that the invasion was  interpreted by investors as real news. This is markedly different to the  GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where there was a lagged response. The  crisis duration metrics suggest that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian  war has been muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19. We  attribute this to the market expectations that the war would not be  prolonged. The findings for commodity markets concur with that of  stock markets except for one aspect: intensity. Commodities generally  appear to have weathered the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis in a similar  way to the Covid-19 and GFC crises. However, crisis intensity values for  specific commodities reveal strong ongoing pressure in this asset class,  and to the economy given the strategic importance of some of these  commodities."
"In the short-term the Russian-Ukrainian war is expected lead to lower  economic growth and rising inflation. Annual GDP growth in 2023 is  projected to slow to 2.25% worldwide, to 0.5% in the US and to 0.25% in  the Euro area; well below pre-war forecasts (OECD, 2022). Following  the gradual global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,  inflationary pressure had already been building up. However, the  Russian-Ukrainian war, with its impact on energy and food prices, has  accelerated the inflationary pressure worldwide.12 On the energy front,  the heavy reliance of the EU on Russia leaves the former vulnerable to  gas supply reductions through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline (Eurostat,  2022; Financial Times, 2022c; World Bank, 2022c). Besides, the within-  EU heterogeneity on gas reliance leaves the union vulnerable to political  tension, for example over the proposed 15% voluntary reduction in gas  usage (The Guardian, 2022a)."
"The long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine will depend on  current policy responses and priorities. Most recently, policy makers  have been promoting energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of en ergy production, which is in line with the green goals of a transition  away from fossil fuels to arrest climate change. However, such goals may  become more elusive if policy makers rank energy security and  affordability higher in their agenda. On the food market front, produc tion shortfalls, trade disruptions and increased input costs raise com modity prices, most notably wheat. Ukrainian wheat exports, that  account for nearly 10% of global exports, ceased after the closure of  Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Exporting wheat overland is more expensive  than by sea (World Bank, 2022a). Rising food prices and disruptions to  trade pose risks to the coherence of the society. Besides, food security  ranks high on the policy makers' agendas; thus necessitating interna tional cooperation on these issues. With regard to metal markets, our  results show that nickel has been heavily affected. Russia accounts for  20% of high-grade nickel used in batteries. Sanctions have disrupted  supply from Russia's mining giant Nornickel. The production of  stainless steel, which accounts for 70% of nickel consumption is slowing,  mainly in China (World Bank, 2022a). Developments in these com modities may affect the affordability of clean forms of transportation,  and ultimately jeopardise the transition to a low-carbon economy."
"The macroeconomic impact via commodity markets and rising in flationary pressure may plunge global economies into recession. Stake holders are concerned about commodity-driven contagion effects that  could have significant implications on financial markets and the real  economy (Financial Times, 2022e). It remains to be seen what remedial  steps will be taken to tackle a global recession. Future studies can further  examine the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war and its far-reaching  effects on global economies as the war unfolds."

"However, it is expected that the effects will be substantial. Since the conflict is ongoing, it is challenging to have  ground-accurate data that could show an idea of the extension of the impact. Remote sensing can support a  preliminary analysis in areas without safety to conduct fieldwork. This work aims to assess the impacts of the  Russian-Ukrainian war on the environment using field and remote sensing sources. This is the first work that  published fieldwork data from this conflict. Different soil properties were studied (e.g., texture and heavy metals)  in different places (Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan). Remote sensing (e.g., Normalised Difference Vegetation  Index) at different spatial scales (Eastern Ukraine and case study in the Kharkiv region) were assessed between  2021 and 2022. The results showed that the finer sediments increased in bombed areas compared with not  bombed ones. Also, there was an increase in the content of heavy metals (e.g., Manganese, Iron, Cobalt, Copper,  Cadmium, Chromium, Lead and Nickel) in soils in the shelled areas, compared to the non-shelled.

"Science of the Total Environment 902 (2023) 166122 2 mainly observed in the Novy Korotych site. Remote sensing analysis revealed that between 2021 and 2022 at a  large scale (Eastern and southeastern Ukraine), vegetation greenness decreased in the areas where the combats  are more intense (Luhansk and Donetsk) and increased in the southern area (Zaporizhia and Kherson), likely due  to agriculture abandonment. On a small scale (case study in Kharkiv region), the vegetation greenness was  affected due to the bombing. Although our results are preliminary, it is important to highlight that shelling is  increasing soil pollution and contributing to vegetation greenness reduction where the fighting is intense. The  actual impacts of the war still need to be understood entirely."
"1. Introduction  The Russian-Ukrainian war dramatically impacts society and the  economy, including life losses, mental health, collective memory,  infrastructure disruption (e.g., housing, health, schools), refugees, and  economic breakdown (e.g., hand labour mobilisation to war; food se curity). These effects can last for many generations, compromising the  future aspirations of the countries involved and, ultimately, the global  stability and the relation among nations (Pereira et al., 2022a, 2022b;  United Nations, 2022a). Although the impacts on society and the  economy are dramatic, the effects of war on the environment cannot be  overlooked. The effects are paradoxical. From one side, war-affected  areas can be depopulated due to the risk of life loss, reducing the  human pressure (e.g., agriculture and industrial activities) on the envi ronment and vegetation and biodiversity recuperation. Examples of this  dynamic were observed in Afghanistan (Zhang et al., 2023), Korean  Demilitarized Zone (Lawrence et al., 2015) and Cyprus dead zone  (Constantinou et al., 2020). On another side, the effects of bombing  contribute to landscape morphology change (e.g., bombturbation,  trenches and tunnels construction, heavy machinery circulation) (Cer tini et al., 2013), pedogenesis (Hupy and Schaetzl, 2006), soil air and  water pollution (e.g., traffic circulation, shelling) (Pereira et al., 2020),  vegetation degradation (e.g., trenches construction, heavy machinery  circulation, wildfires, (e.g., Omar et al., 2005), and biodiversity and  habitat loss (e.g., clear cuts, pollution, wild animals hunting) in terres trial and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., Hanson, 2018). These impacts can last  long, depending on the wartime and conflict intensity. Overall, the  adverse effects are always high than the benefits (Hanson, 2018). For  instance, shelling, mines and trench construction destroy or remix soil  horizons (Pereira et al., 2020). Heavy machinery circulation and  bombing destroy soil cover and increase compaction, erosion and  pollution (e.g., Abdo, 2018). Previous works observed that in areas  affected by war, soil texture changes, there is an increase of trace  metals/radioactive elements/oil products/energetic materials/nitro aromatic explosives/organophosphorus nerve agents and a reduction of  macro and microbiological activity, water infiltration, organic matter  and key nutrients (e.g., carbon and nitrogen) (e.g., Al-Awadhi and  Misak, 2005; Broomandi et al., 2020; Freije, 2015). Vegetation loss is  affected directly by the shelling, grenades or mines, and wildfires pro duced by these explosions. Clear cuts imposed by warfare activities and  heavy machinery passage reduce vegetation cover (e.g., Robinson and  Sutherland, 2002; Nackoney et al., 2014; Katayama et al., 2015). All  these impacts conduce to a dramatic reduction of habitats and the  biodiversity of the affected areas. In addition, in war zones, wildlife  hunting increases (e.g., Gaynor et al., 2016)."
"Remote sensing techniques (Witmar, 2015) are crucial to assessing  environmental conditions in large-scale areas and when accessibility is  limited, as in the case of war. They are essential to understand the  spatiotemporal impacts of the conflict and when the intensity (e.g.,  selling is more intense) or where there is a vegetation recuperation due  to land abandonment (e.g., Zhang et al., 2023). Remote sensing-based  studies have been applied to assess the impact of armed conflicts in  Afghanistan (Beck, 2003; Zhang et al., 2023), Syria (Lubin and Saleem,  2019), Kuwait (Ajmi and Din, 2009), Iraque (Jahjah et al., 2007), Sierra  Leone (Gbanie et al., 2018), Bosnia (Witmer, 2008), South Sudan  (Mackenhauer Olsen et al., 2021), Liberia (Enaruvbe et al., 2019),  Mynamar (Shwesin Aung, 2021), Colombia (Camargo et al., 2020),  second world war (Poland) (Waga and Fajer, 2021) at different scales, e."
"g., local (Lubin and Saleem, 2019) and National (Zhang et al., 2023). In  Ukraine, only one work was developed, but it was very local and did not  assess the impacts at a large scale, especially in the areas where the  intensity of the combats is the highest. Also, no spectral indices were  conducted, and the impacts were not quantified. The work was con ducted immediately after the war (Shevchuck et al., 2022)."
The ongoing war in Ukraine is a dramatic event for global security.
"Their impacts are global, and several reports highlight their impacts on  food security (FAO, 2022), poverty (UNICEF, 2022), inflation (Guenette  et al., 2022), energy prices (United Nations, 2022b), global trade  (UNCTAD, 2022), human rights (United Nations Human Rights, 2022),  inequality, education (United Nations, 2022b) unemployment (Inter national Labour Organization, 2022), health, gender equality (United  Nations, 2022c), cultural heritage (European Parliament, 2023) political  relations,1 population displacement (UNICEF, 2023), population  vulnerability to natural disasters (Pereira et al., 2022a), global agendas  (e.g., sustainable development goals) (Pereira et al., 2022b), global  governance2 and the environment (Pereira et al., 2022a). The environ ment is one of the most affected. The war negatively affects the envi ronment, including air quality and greenhouse gas emissions,  biodiversity, soil and landscape morphology, and water availability and  quality. This ultimately will reduce the capacities of the ecosystems to  supply ecosystem services in quantity and quality (Pereira et al., 2022a)."
"Although the Russian-Ukrainian war is an ongoing conflict, and we do  not have the dimension of the full impacts of this conflict, it is important  to understand the effects on the environment, which to some extent, are  not completely assessed (Pereira et al., 2022a). The difficulty of going to  the field and in war-affected areas increases the challenge of obtaining  field-based data and better understanding the impacts of shelling on the  environment. For instance, most of the works during ongoing conflicts  were conducted using remote sensing techniques, such as in Syria (e.g.,  Abdo, 2018; Daiyoub et al., 2023), Mynamar (Shwesin Aung, 2021) and  South Sudan (Olsen et al., 2021). However, more information about  field evidence in ongoing conflicts must be available. Although this is a  challenging step, it is important to know it. From field surveys, obtaining  more accurate and reliable data and the true content of a determined  parameter (e.g., soil texture, pollutant concentration) is possible. Using  remote sensing techniques, we can only estimate indicators based on  surface reflectance information from individual bands' reflectance and/  or the different band combinations (e.g., spectral indexes). Therefore,  although more local, field surveys provide more accurate data than  remote sensing techniques. This work presents field-based data on this  conflict for the first time. To better understand the effects of the war on  the environment, remote sensing analyses were conducted at different  scales. This pilot study aims to assess the impacts of shelling on a few soil  properties (e.g., texture and heavy metals) and vegetation cover (Nor malised Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI) in the first year after the  war."

"Science of the Total Environment 902 (2023) 166122 3 2. Materials and methods  2.1. Study area, experimental design and laboratory analysis  Soils were sampled in two different areas near Kharkiv, and remote  sensing analyses were conducted in eastern and southeast parts of  Ukraine (Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson) and  Dolyna Slovyansky District (hereafter case study) (Fig. 1). The average  annual temperature (19812010) of the study areas varies from 8 C  (Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk) to 9 C (Zaporizhia) and 10 C (Kher son). The average annual precipitation (19812010) oscillates between  140 and 150 mm (Kharkiv), to 130120 mm (Luhansk and Donetsk) and  110120 mm (Zaporizhia and Kherson) (Balabukh and Malytska, 2017)."
"Soil sampling areas (Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan) were located in  cropland areas (Fig. 1). According to WRB (2014), the soils were clas sified as chernozems. In Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan, samples were  collected (April 1415, 2022) in a control area (50 m from the crater)  with the same land use. In both study sites, bomb craters were identified  visually. Inside the crater (Novy Korotych), samples were collected at  different positions, bottom of the crater, wall of the crater and top of the  crater. In each position, 3 subsamples were collected and mixed to form  a composite sample. The mixed sample was packed and labelled for  laboratory analysis. In Mala Rohan, only one sample was taken inside  the bottom of the crater. Here the field procedures for sampling were the  same as in Novy Korotych. Samples were transported to the laboratory  and dried in an oven at a temperature of 35 C for 24 h. Subsequently,  samples were sieved (2 mm mesh) and separated into two fractions, one  for texture other for chemical analysis. The size of soil particles was  determined using the laser diffraction method on a Mastersizer 3000E  particle analyser from Malvern Instruments with a HydroEV liquid  dispersion module. Carbonates were removed using hydrochloric acid  with a molar concentration of 0.2 and 0.05 mol/dm3, and disaggrega tion was done using a sodium hydroxide solution with a molar con centration of 1 mol/dm3. Based on these parameters, the Mastersizer  3000E will measure the particle size distribution of the soil sample by  passing a laser beam through the sample dispersed in water and  measuring the diffraction pattern of the scattered light. The Mit theory  was used to calculate the particle size distribution from the diffraction  Fig. 1. Study areas."

"2.2. Data, spatial and statistical analysis  Landsat 8 imagery (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) with a resolu tion of 30 m (Eastern and southeast Ukraine) and PlanetScope imagery  with 3 m resolution (case study) (Planet Team, 2023) were used for  remote sensing analysis. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index  (NDVI) was used to assess vegetation cover (Jiang et al., 2021), and it  was calculated in the Google Earth Engine platform (https://eart  hengine.google.com/). This index was used to assess the impact of the  war on vegetation greenness. NDVI was calculated using the Near  Infrared (NIR) and Red (R) bands based on the formula:  (NIR Red) (NIR + Red) The process in Google Earth Engine encompassed (1) filtering the  dates to cover the month of June 2021 and 2022 for the eastern and  southeast parts of Ukraine Images from 25 to 06-2021/29-06-2022 were  used for the case study; (2) selecting a single harmonised surface  reflection image; (3) export the image as a raster; (4) import into ArcGIS  Pro (ESRI, 2022) for spatial analysis and mapping."
"2.3. Statistical analysis  For statistical analysis, a fishnet (1 km resolution for eastern Ukraine  and 10 m resolution for the case study) was conducted using the ArcGIS  Pro fishnet tool. Data was collected from the rasters data set (2021 and  2022) using the ArcGIS Pro extract multivalues to point tool. Significant  differences between NDVI values between 2021 and 2022 (eastern  Ukraine and case study) were conducted with a non-parametric Wil coxon rank test, and significant differences were considered at a p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was carried out using JASP (https://jasp-stats."
org/).
"3. Results and discussion  3.1. Soil texture and heavy metals  The results showed that in Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan, the % of  20.5 mm particles was lower in the bombed area than in the control."
"The same was observed in Mala Rohan (Table 1). The explosion imposed  by shelling may have increased the % of soil fine sediments due to  particle slaking. Bomb explosions detach and redistribute large amounts  of soil. It is well known that bombs substantially affect soil physical  degradation (Poesen, 2018), as can be observed in Fig. S1. Table 2 shows  the metal content in Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan. In Novy Korotych,  except for Zn, all the other metals were higher in the bombed areas than  in control. Concerning Mala Rohan, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb were  higher in the shelled area compared to the control. In Fig. S1 (taking as  an example Lysychansk), region), it is visible in some areas, a high  density of craters created by bombs. Therefore, it is likely that the im pacts of shelling in these areas on soil physical and chemical degradation  are high. Bomb explosions increase dramatically the presence of metals  in soil, as highlighted in different works (e.g., Certini et al., 2013;  Broomandi et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020) due to the substances  released. Previous reports highlighted high contamination in soils  affected by war activities in different areas of the world. For instance,  Hussain and Gondal (2008), found that in soils exposed to military ac tivities in the Gulf War (1991)- Saudi Arabia -, the levels of Cr and Fe  increased substantially. Similar results were identified by Sadiq et al."
"(1992) in Kuwait, where Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Ni levels were very high in  soils affected by military activities (e.g., oil fires) and in areas affected  by military activities during WWI (Pas-de-Calais, France), Williams and  Rintoul-Hynes (2022) observed that some areas were enriched with Cu  and Pb. Meerschman et al. (2011) also identified Ypres war zone  (Belgium) (WWI), that several areas had a high concentration of Cu and  Pb due to warfare activities. Thestorf and Makki (2022) found that in  Berlin (Germany), soils and war debris from WWII were enriched in Cd,  Cu, Ni, Pb and Fe."
"3.2. Remote sensing analysis  Table 3 shows the NDVI results for the Ukraine eastern and south eastern and case study for 2021 and 2022. The results showed that in the  first area, the NDVI values were significantly higher in 2022 than in  2021, while in the case study area, the opposite was observed. Figs. 2  and 3 show the NDVI spatial distribution in both areas. In Ukraine's  eastern and southeastern areas, analysing images with 30 m resolution,  we did not identify a clear spatial pattern in the Kharkiv region. In the  southern area (Zaporizhia and Kherson), in 2022, several areas were  greener than in 2021. In Kherson, there were examples of land aban donment (Fig. S3). This may be attributed to migration and the aban donment of agricultural activities in the country's southeastern part  (Zaporizhia and Kherson). Another hypothesis is that this could be due  to crop rotation, which can occur in some instances. This possibility is  not excluded. However, there were shreds of evidence of land aban donment in the cases we spotted, for example, in point 7 of Fig. S3. In  Fig. S4, it is visible from the land use history that the area was inten sively used for agriculture from 2014 until 2021. In 2022 after the war  started, it was observed that there was no soil tillage to plant crops."
"There is evidence of spontaneous vegetation growth when soil should be  prepared for crop plantation, thus, evidence of agriculture abandonment  (e.g., Baeten et al., 2010; Khorchani et al., 2020; Fig. S3). The war  provoked a massive population movement in Ukraine. It is estimated  that 7 million people went abroad and 5.3 million are displaced inter nally.3 A recent report showed that several households reduced or  ceased4 agricultural practices. Previous works observed that in war-  affected areas, land abandonment increased vegetation development  (e.g., Zhang et al., 2023). This was observed in other areas affected by  wars, such as in Vietnam (Lacombe et al., 2010), Chechen wars (Yin  et al., 2019), Bosnia (Witmer, 2008), Croatia (Mikulic et al., 2014), Syria  (Hazaymeh et al., 2022), Nicaragua (Stevens et al., 2011) and Poland  (WWII) (Latocha et al., 2016). In Luhansk and Donetsk, a decrease was  identified. For instance, the comparison between satellite images from  2021 and 2022 showed that greening areas decreased (Fig. 2). This was  attributed to vegetation degradation caused by wildfires due to shelling  (Fig. S3). At a large-scale analysis (Ukraine's eastern and southeastern),  Table 1  Soil granulometry in bombed and non-bombed areas in Novy Korotych and Mala  Rohan."

Solokha et al.
"Science of the Total Environment 902 (2023) 166122 5 we observed that greening decreased in some areas while others  increased. For instance, war has been more intense in Luhansk and  Donetsk, and the shelling is highly dense, as shown in Fig. S2. This  contributes to explaining the vegetation greenness decrease in these  areas. In the case study, we found a similar situation. Shelling and  bombing substantially degraded forested and agricultural areas (Fig. 3)."
"Previous works observed that vegetation and biodiversity are severely  affected in places where war activities are intense (e.g., Lawrence et al.,  2015; Kanyamibwa, 1998; Hanson, 2018; Pereira et al., 2022a,Pereira  et al., 2022b). This was easier to identify in the case study due to the fine  resolution of the images obtained (3 m) (Fig. 4). It was possible to  identify the bomb's impacts on vegetation. The negative impacts of  armed conflicts on vegetation were also identified in other places such as  the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Nackoney et al., 2014), Vietnam  (Lacombe et al., 2010), Cambodia (Kiernan, 2010), the Czech Republic  (WWII) (Dolej s et al., 2020), Syria (Almohamad, 2020) and Iraq (Aliyas,  2016)."
"3.3. Limitations and uncertainties  The soil data described in this work will likely be the first from this  war. We acknowledge that it might not represent the area, and the  number of samples is minimal, giving an incomplete picture of the im pacts of bombturbation on soil texture and metals. Detailed studies are  needed. However, the results showed that the impacts are similar to  those observed in other war zones. This is an ongoing conflict, and it is  highly challenging and risky to go to the field. It is unpredictable the  areas that will be bombed. Therefore, it is extremely risky to go to the  field. However, it is crucial to have access to the areas where the com bats are more intense and sample soils, vegetation and water to have a  concrete picture of the impacts of the war on the environment. Also, the  effects after the war finish can be high than what we observe now,  making our results limited and uncertain to some extent. There are  several limitations regarding the large-scale assessment, mainly because  the resolution is coarse and lacks detail. For instance, it is difficult to  identify the impacts of bombs on vegetation and soils. In our work, at a  large scale, we identified vegetation greenness in the southern part of  Ukraine. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis at a finer resolution showed  that bombs substantially impacted the vegetation and soils."

Science of the Total Environment 902 (2023) 166122 8 3.4. Implications for management  The impacts of this war on the environment are largely uncertain.
"However, they are expected to be substantial (Pereira et al., 2022a), and  it is expected to be a toxic legacy5 of this event. According to the  OECD6 The war has caused widespread and severe damage to the envi ronment and inflicted both immediate and longer-term consequences on the  human health, ecosystems and the Ukrainian economy and beyond.. It is  challenging to estimate these impacts. Nevertheless, it is key to assess  them once the war ends. Another impact that needs to be considered is  the long-term impact of war on the environment. Several works high lighted that wars have long-term impacts on soil, water, air and biodi versity (e.g., Bardgett, 2016; Schillinger et al., 2020; Rawtani et al.,  2022). For instance, increasing heavy metals in the bombed areas  observed in this work can contribute to soil, water and biodiversity  degradation. This can increase land degradation and be reflected ulti mately in society (e.g., human health) and the economy (land produc tivity). Land degradation provoked by war can have numerous negative  implications on regulation (e.g., air and water purification, noise regu lation, climate regulation, flood regulation, carbon sequestration,  pollination), provisioning (e.g., food production, medicinal plants,  biomass) and cultural (e.g., recreation, landscape aesthetics, cultural  heritage, social cohesion) (Pereira et al., 2022). Several concerns have  been raised about the impacts of this war on global food security (Eu ropean Parliament, 2022; FAO, 2022; Lin et al., 2023). This can be  accentuated if the ecosystems are damaged. This needs to be considered  as well. Another important aspect is the negative impacts on cultural  heritage that are ongoing due to shelling. The impacts of war on climate  change (e.g., greenhouse emissions) and how climate change events (e."
"g., floods or droughts) will affect an area environmentally, socially and  economically damaged must also be understood. Understanding that  these effects can occur and preventing them will be key to improving  post-war management. Several works highlighted that the impacts of  climate change could be severe (e.g. Kireitseva et al., 2023). Neverthe less, it is also true that the war triggered a transition to the use of cleaner  energy (e.g., Nerlinger and Utz, 2022). Another important aspect is that  this conflict hampered important global goals such as the Sustainable  Development Goals. COVID19 affected the capacity of several coun tries (e.g., mainly from the global south) to meet the proposed targets?."
"The war accentuated these difficulties. Some reports7 highlighted that  achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030 is extremely  challenging (Pereira et al., 2022b; UNDP, 2022). Overall, there is a need  for large-scale environmental restoration in Ukraine after the war. It is  unpredictable the damage extension. The necessity of the establishment  of a well-coordinated plan of environmental restoration has been high lighted by different institutions such as World Wildlife Foundation,8  United Nations,9 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop ment.10 Although preliminary, the results obtained in this work support  the idea that there is a need for a major restoration strategy in Ukraine  after the war."
"4. Conclusions  Under the current conditions, it is challenging to collect data in the  field and have a comprehensive idea about the impacts of the Russian-  Ukrainian war on the environment. Remote sensing techniques can be  a solution to understanding the effects. This is the first work that pub lishes data about the impacts of the war on soil properties. The impacts  of the bombing on the soils of the studied area are evident. For instance,  the % of fine sediments and most heavy metals increased. Remote  sensing analysis at a larger scale revealed that between 2021 and 2022,  greening areas decreased in the areas where the combats are more  intense (Luhansk and Donetsk), while in other areas located in south eastern Ukraine (Zaporizhia and Kherson), increased due to agriculture  practices abandonment. Population migration affected vegetation dy namics. At small scales analysis, it was observed that the vegetation was  damaged due to the shelling. Further works need to be conducted on the  field to understand the impacts of the war on soil, water and biodiver sity. Studies focused on remote sensing analysis must be assessed at  different scales and with a large temporal spectrum."

"The geopolitics of supply chains: Assessing the consequences of the  Russo-Ukrainian war for B2B relationships  Jagdish N. Sheth a, Can Uslay b  a Goizueta Business School, Emory University, 1300 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30322, United States  b Rutgers Business School at Newark and New Brunswick, Rutgers University, 100 Rockafeller Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, United States    A R T I C L E  I N F O    Keywords:  Russo-Ukrainian War  B2B markets  Industrial marketing  Contingency theory  Disruption  Supply chain management  A B S T R A C T    History suggests that the Russo-Ukrainian war could prove to be a prolonged conflict. It has already disrupted  supply chains of basic necessities such as wheat and energy and changed the global business landscape. In  particular, B2B firms are learning to improvise and devise new sourcing strategies. Many manufacturers are  working on diversifying their approach to sourcing and developing new offerings with alternative ingredients/  components or energy sources. In this article, the authors discuss eight consequences of a prolonged conflict and  discuss their implications on B2B markets and supply chains."
"1. Introduction  Despite the size and importance of B2B marketing, there have been  ongoing concerns regarding a consistent lack of scholarly attention to it  (Danneels & Lilien, 1998; Malhotra & Uslay, 2009; LaPlaca & Katrichis,  2009; Lilien, 2016; Mora Cortez & Johnston, 2017; Webster 1978). This  is especially problematic since B2C pipelines rely on the vigor of B2B  marketing activities; a vast majority of businesses are not vertically in tegrated. Buyer behavior, as well as impactful B2B marketing, depends  heavily on the context (Sheth, 2011; Sheth et al., 2022b). There are few  laws and lawlike generalizations in marketing that can transcend con texts (Sheth & Sisodia, 1999). Thus, contingency theory (Chandler,  1962; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967a, 1967b; Ruekert, Walker, & Roering,  1985; Woodward, 1965; Zeithaml, Varadarajan, & Zeithaml, 1988)  which suggests that the optimal way to organize, operate or manage an  organization depends on the internal and external factors, is uniquely  applicable to B2B relationships. The current study complements the  extant B2B marketing research efforts using contingency theory (e.g.,  Chung et al., 2021; Gnizy & Shoham, 2018; Hughes et al., 2020; Tang pong, Hung, & Li, 2019) with its macro perspective and focus on the  black swan eventthe Russo-Ukrainian war."
"There are currently at least five primary external drivers that shape  B2B markets and relationships. Not surprisingly, the first macro driver is  technology. Enterprise resource planning and customer relationship  platforms such as SAP and Salesforce have significantly boosted the  productivity of businesses over the last few decades. Along the same  time frame, e-commerce and more recently, the social media and mobile  revolution have also reset expectations for on-demand service, online  procurement, and delivery across supply chains. Next, the deployment  of artificial intelligence will set new frontiers for productivity. Indeed,  ChatGPT has set a world record by reaching 100 million users in just two  months (Hu, 2023)."
"A second driver is governmental regulation. The recent movement  towards tariffs and trade wars have already been shaping procurement  practices. Domestic counterpart of these international headwinds are  taxation, subsidies, and antitrust action. In the long run, climate change  will also force governments to take action."
"A third driver is demographic diversity. Changing characteristics  such as average age, discretionary income, ethnic backgrounds, and  lifestyles of target markets have significant implications for upstream  B2B markets and procurement as well."
"The fourth driver is the rise of emerging markets and a new world  order configuration. In terms of purchasing power parity-based GDP,  China and India have replaced the traditional powerhouses of Europe,  and Japan to join the United States as triad powers (Sheth, Uslay, &  Sisodia, 2022; IMF, 2023). Multinational corporations from emerging  markets are rising to global leadership by utilizing their skill and do mestic scale advantages, focused M&A, key account relationships, and  understanding of emerging markets to switch from offering OEM to  branded products and services (Sheth, 2011; Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia,  2020)."
"An increasingly important fifth area that has been by and large  ignored until recently is how to deal with ad-hoc global crises. Before  Covid-19, we had cases and studies that dealt with consumer backlash  E-mail addresses: jag@jagsheth.com (J.N. Sheth), can.uslay@business.rutgers.edu (C. Uslay)."

The  growing incidence of local disasters such as hurricanes, tsunami,  earthquakes, more recently the Covid-19 pandemic, and finally the war  in Ukraine all indicate that dealing with unanticipated crises, natural or  man-made, needs to become part of the skillset executives need to learn  sooner, or they will have to learn on the job more painfully later.1  Grewal, Johnson, and Sarker (Grewal et al. (2007)) offered a typology of  crises using three dimensions: (1) endogenous/exogenous to interfirm  relationships, (2) localized versus pervasive impact, and (3) slow-  evolving versus immediate. The Russo-Ukrainian conflict represents a  special case: Even though it can be considered an exogeneous shock with  immediate impact for many local/subsidiary businesses that were forced  to exit, this categorization could be myopic. Even though the war zone  has been confined so far, the impact of the war in Ukraine on supply  chains is arguably already global. Similarly, while the lives of many  citizens and businesses were changed overnight, the pervasive impact  for the markets in the rest of the world has been slow-evolving and likely  to remain so."
"In business academia, there is limited literature on the impact of  wars, such as civil, international, or world wars I or II. Besides the ex ceptions in history, journalism, and sociology, other academic disci plines are not much more advanced than business in examining the  context of war. All of this started to change when the pandemic offered a  costly wake-up call. We applaud the efforts of chief editors, guest edi tors, and researchers for their agility in orchestrating, developing, and  offering special issues and impactful research on Covid-19 on markets  and marketing."
"Contributing to that backdrop, the purpose of our paper is to  conceptualize the likely consequences of a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war  on B2B marketing and supply chains from a contingency theory  perspective. The reason for our focus is two-fold:   a) While it is more straightforward to discuss the magnitude and  speculate on the aftermath of a short conflict, the key consequences  of a prolonged conflict are much more challenging to anticipate and  prepare for B2B firms, making it potentially an even more worth while topic."
"b) Unfortunately, recent history suggests that the escalated military  conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to persist for some time."
"Economic embargo against Russia has not achieved devastating  impact and Russia remains unwilling to give up her claims in  Ukraine. Russian conflicts elsewhere have persisted. For example,  Russian military has been deployed in Syria since 2015, and even the  current war in Ukraine can be traced back to Russias annexation of  Crimea in 2014 (Center for Preventive Action, 2022). It is also not  possible to count out the scenario that the war could spread to other  countries/regions in the future."
"We hope that the researchers and practitioners alike will benefit from  the insights, perspectives, and research questions put forth in this article."
"Given the likelihood of a persistent conflict and future unanticipated  events, B2B firms need to consider how this and other disruptions could  affect their operations and prepare accordingly. In addition to antici pating the recurring contraction and recovery periods of business cycles  (Mora Cortez, Johnston, & Ehret, 2023), businesses must assess poten tial risks and develop contingency plans in the face of increasing  geopolitical instability (Sheth & Sisodia, 2006a)."
"2. Crisis uniqueness  The detestable act of war will undoubtedly have immense conse quences for those engaged in it voluntarily or otherwise, including  innocent citizens. The war will certainly have significant consequences  even for regions not involved in the conflict directly. For example,  countries which have been impacted in a significant way, and whose  geopolitical alignments are being tested include Estonia, Finland, and  Sweden. Businesses have also been forced to exit markets due to  geopolitical turbulences; while some never made it back, others had to  wait on the sidelines for years before re-entering (Yayla et al., 2018)."
"Thus far, over a thousand multinationals have scaled back or suspended  their operations in Russia whereas over 200 corporations such as  Dentsu, Honeywell, Kantar, Maersk, McKinsey, International Paper,  PWC, Scania, Schneider, Siemens, Shell, Tetra Pak, and Otis have  already exited (for a full list, see Leave-Russia.org)."
"It is worth noting that a unique aspect of the conflict in Ukraine  (unlike the conflicts in Syria or Afghanistan) is that both countries  control the supply of a large share of essential raw materials. For  example, Ukraine produces 10% of wheat, 16% of corn, and 40% of  sunflower oil globally (Green, 2022). Together, Russia and Ukraine  export over 25% wheat and almost 80% sunflower oil, and Russia and its  ally Belarus account for 15% of worlds fertilizer exports (The Guardian,  2022). Russia produced about 10% worlds oil prior to the invasion of  Ukraine (Kilian & Plante, 2022) and is also the largest exporter of nat ural gas in the world and is home to the worlds largest reserves (USEIA,  2022). Natural gas is also utilized to produce fertilizers."
"Putting eggs in one/few baskets brings in more vulnerability to  systemic shocks and diminished supply chain resilience. No doubt then,  the Russo-Ukrainian war has caused disruption for Egypt, which used to  import over 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and is now  looking to India in an effort to diversify its suppliers (USDA, 2022), or  Moldova which sourced over 90% of its wheat from Ukraine. The price  of wheat in Africa has soared by 45% since the beginning of the war  (Green, 2022)."
"At any price, the availability of these upstream raw materials deeply  impacts the ability of manufacturers to produce downstream products  and can quickly bring assembly lines to a halt. A recent analog to this has  been recently observed in the production of automotive, consumer  electronics, LEDs, and power turbines due to shortages in semi conductors (Dooley, 2021). The lack of one component can and has  created major backlogs in production. The most significant and obvious  risks of the Russo-Ukrainian war to the supply chains are in food security  due to disruptions in wheat, sunflower oil, and fertilizers and energy  security due to the disruptions of the supply of oil and natural gas. These  developments bring about the need for deeper publicprivate-govern ment partnerships and mindful marketing practices in the B2B sector  (Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011)."
"Against this backdrop, we anticipate eight consequences of a pro longed conflict in Ukraine: 1. competition gives way to cartelization, 2."
"diverging power of suppliers as strategic and non-strategic, 3. saved by  new entrants, especially private equity capitalists, 4. customers strike  back by backward integration, 5. rise of the substitutes such as alter native energy sources and electric vehicles, 6. public policy intervention  for market security, 7. guns for butter such as barter of raw materials  with weapons, 8. new bedfellows, especially with resource-rich nations."
We believe that our long-term view and focus on enduring effects as  opposed to temporary shocks make these consequences uniquely rele vant for successfully forging B2B relationships.
"3. Consequences of prolonged Russo-Ukrainian conflict  As previously noted, marketing is a contextual discipline, and the  study of situational effects have been identified as an area of research  shortage in B2B marketing (Sheth & Sharma, 2006). Increased market  volatility underlines the importance of environmental fit and  1 The need for contingency-focused training is now being widely recognized:  content coverage of disruption management (e.g., supply chain disruptions),  preparedness, scenario planning, and risk management/reduction are gaining  ground in executive education as well as traditional curricula. State-of-the-art  simulations are becoming available (e.g., dealing with cyber-attacks)."
J.N. Sheth and C. Uslay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
"Journal of Business Research 166 (2023) 114120 3 adaptability even further (Whalen et al., 2016)."
"Previous prolonged conflicts have also impacted markets in profound  ways. For example, World War II created a shortage of men in  employment age and with encouragement by the federal government,  participation of women in the US workforce increased almost by half,  and many women occupied positions traditionally held by men (Rose,  2018). Along with the civil rights movement, World War II helped to  redefine and significantly broaden womens work and narrow the  wage gap. Other prolonged conflicts include the civil war in Colombia  (19642016), Sri Lanka (19832009), Syria (2011 -, and Yemen  (2014 -."
"While each conflict has had its unique consequences, they have all  resulted in a surge in the number of refugees. This has also been the case  in Ukraine. Over eight million refugees have moved to Europe so far and  even larger numbers were forced to relocate domestically. Evidence  from Poland and UK suggests that these refugees are able to secure jobs  and integrate to Europes labor force (Bird & Noumon, 2022). Other  common consequences naturally include reduced foreign investment,  trade restrictions, damage to reputation in the global arena, security  risks, exits by foreign businesses, and disrupted supply chains, all of  which have already been observed in the Russo-Ukrainian war."
"The main premise of contingency theory is that organizational  effectiveness is a function of the fit between organizational structure,  strategy, and environment (Chandler, 1962; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967a,  1967b; Woodward, 1965). Hence, the critical role of external factors  (market competition, technology change, legal and regulatory envi ronment, social and cultural factors and focal to our article, political and  economic factors) are explicitly recognized."
"Next, we discuss eight anticipated consequences that will result from  the circumstances of a prolonged conflict from a contingency perspec tive (Van de Ven & Drazin, 1984). These consequences are also illus trated in Fig. 1."
"1. Competition gives way to cartelization: While conventional thinking  may view them as opposites, the relationship between the level of  competition and collaboration in markets is arguably U-shaped  (Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 2020). That is, collaborative behavior in  markets is commonplace when competition is low but starts to  decline as competitive intensity increases. However, when markets  get too competitive, players are compelled to create pacts and alli ances to survive. We have recently observed this phenomenon with  the Saudi-led OPECs alignment with Russia to form OPEC+ (Northam, 2022; Ulrichsen et al., 2022). Repeating the scenario from  the earlier energy crises of the seventies and from 2003 to 2008  where the barrel of crude oil reached $147, the likely outcome of  collusion will be outsized monopoly profits. In fact, oil companies  have already been reporting record profits thanks to rising com modity prices (e.g., Meredith & Amaro, 2022)."
2. Diverging power of suppliers: We foresee two main pathways for sec tors impacted by supply chain disruptions. High value-add sectors (e.
"g., pharmaceuticals) will rely on their margins to find a way to thrive  despite inflation and rising commodity prices, whereas low value-  add sectors (e.g., processed foods) will be forced to consolidate."
"Fertilizers are critical for agriculture, whereas oil is essential for  petrochemicals as well as pharmaceuticals, not to mention trans portation. XPO Logistics acquisition of Kuehne + Nagels European  operations is a recent example of consolidation (Berman, 2021)."
"3. Saved by private capital: Downstream manufacturers without raw  materials to operate are likely to face cash flow problems. This will  present significant opportunities for private equity and sovereign  funds to come in and acquire them at a discount. This was also the  pattern observed in the eighties in the aftermath of the first energy  crisis. While pandemics decrease aggregate demand and do not  necessarily cause inflation, prolonged wars increase aggregate de mand, and are typically followed by higher interest rates, invest ment, and inflation (Daly and Chankova (2021)). It is also worth  noting that multinationals from emerging markets have much more  experience in dealing with inflationary environments and consoli dating markets. As such, they will be more likely to identify oppor tunities in what incumbents may view as a highly challenging  landscape. For example, Temasek of Singapore has recently brokered  a merger between two struggling investments, Keppel and Sembcorp  Marine to create the worlds largest oil-rig builder (Burgos, 2022)."
Consequences Competition gives way  to cartelization Diverging power of  suppliers Saved by private  capital Customers strike  back Innovations for  substitutes Public policy  intervention Guns for butter New bedfellows Fig. 1. Consequences of prolonged Russo-Ukrainian conflict.
J.N. Sheth and C. Uslay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
"Journal of Business Research 166 (2023) 114120 4 4. Customers strike back: Large B2B customers that fall short in supplies  and/or increasingly wary of such shortages will look to acquire  suppliers and integrate backwards. Historically, petro-chemical giant  Duponts record-breaking acquisition of Conoco (then ninth largest  oil and second largest coal company in US) in 1981 is an example of  this (Scherer, 1981). A more recent example is LyondellBasells  $2.25B acquisition of A. Schulman in 2018 allowing it to integrate  deeper to the production of specialized plastics and expand its  advanced polymer solutions (Goldsberry, 2018)."
"5. Innovations for substitutes: From oil and gas shortages, global sub stitutes will emerge. Germany already decided to postpone the  phasing out of its nuclear power plants and restart using coal-based  plants to improve its energy security as a temporary measure (Con nolly (2022)). Even in the US, there are plans to re-open nuclear  plants and extend the shut-down dates of existing ones (including the  last operational plant in environmentally conscious California)  (Canon, 2022) and President Biden recently approved an eight  billion-dollar drilling project in Alaska in a reversal of his staunch  no more drilling on federal lands, period campaign position  (Friedman (2023)). Other nations such as India and Turkey are also  reconsidering the role of nuclear in their energy portfolio."
"Meanwhile, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark have  already pledged to increase EUs offshore wind power capacity by  tenfold by 2050 (Reuters, 2022). Ultimately, solar and hydrogen power  will also increase their market share, and substitute for oil and gas."
"Similarly, wheat can be substituted by other grains as it is already the  case in South Korea with rice flour (Neo, 2022). Potato pulp can serve as  a partial substitute to wheat and help generate energy- and cost-efficient  steamed bread with more nutrition (Cao et al., 2019). Cauliflower rice  has also been trending up as a healthier choice, and some restaurants  have been successfully experimenting with it (Chipotle (2022)). In India,  the government is trying to reposition millets (traditionally referred to  as poor mans grain despite their nutritious content) as a super food  and supporting the Indian Institute of Millet Research to become a global  hub for millet R&D (Jain (2023)). In the end, it may not be one grain but  a combination of them that wins over the consumers, indicating that  more product innovation on substitutes is inevitable."
"6. Public policy intervention: Private sector lacks both capital and in centives to build infrastructure or cope with climate change (Bordoff  & OSullivan, 2022). Therefore, governments will need to intervene  and make large-scale investments and/or lead publicprivate co alitions. The efforts by Lithuanian and German governments to  invest in floating liquefied natural gas terminals to diversify sup pliers are examples of this (Bordoff & OSullivan, 2022)."
"While energy security is top of mind due to the relatively fresh  memories of the first and second energy crises, food security has always  been a concern for emerging nations in Africa and elsewhere. Similarly,  interventions for securing essential minerals such as lithium, nickel and  cobalt will be next due to their importance in the battery-hungry in formation age. Federal regulation will also influence the conduct of state  and local governments, which in turn will shape the markets. In the end,  there will be unique opportunities to forge tri-sector collaborations be tween the government, the private, and the NGOs for innovative solu tions to utilize assets more effectively and address forthcoming  shortages (Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 2020; Uslay, 2019)."
"7. Guns for butter: Recent headwinds against globalization and global  trade is likely to spur growth in new bartering arrangements. Bilat eral or multilateral barters can uniquely overcome cash flow prob lems as well as currency fluctuations. For example, Pepsi is known  for bartering its soda for Russian vodka and even warships (Ramirez,  1990). We anticipate that developed countries with advanced  weapon systems will be willing to sell these in exchange for raw  materials such as wheat, oil, and gas."
"8. New bedfellows: As previously noted, when competition for scarce  resources becomes excessive, the outcome is more collaborative  behavior, coalitions, and new alignments (Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia,  2020). Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was raised in  East Germany and spoke Russian fluently, was able to negotiate a  natural gas purchase agreement with Russia after the collapse of  communism (Marton, 2022). She was then able to rationalize shut ting down the nuclear plants and garner the political clout to get the  legislation passed. Two natural gas pipelines (Nord Stream 1 and 2)  were built and peaceful relationships prevailed between Germany  and Russia. With the invasion of Ukraine, all of that has changed and  Germany is currently actively looking for alternative partners/  suppliers."
"This implies a seismic shift in geopolitical alignments which in turn  will shake up B2B markets toward further volatility. A consequence of  energy/resource crises may be the creation of alternative paradigms/  innovations and a more multilateral perspective that makes the world  less reliant on non-democratic regimes.2 Nevertheless, the choices for  alternative alignments/partners are not infinite and more difficult due  to the current geopolitical environment: the US happens to be the  leading producer of natural gas (934 billion cubic meters), followed by  Russia (702 bcm), Iran (257 bcm), and China (209 bcm) (Pistilli 2022)."
"Similarly, the US has been the leading producer of oil (18.88 million  barrels per day), followed by Saudi Arabia (10.84 mbpd), Russia (10.78  mbpd), and Canada (5.54 mbpd) based on 2021 data (US EIA, 2022)."
"Meanwhile, those already with uneasy relations with the US may end up  as economic allies of Russia despite their military ties with Western al liances with NATO and the EU."
"4. Implications and research questions  Despite the conventional wisdom that downstream activities have  higher margins, upstream businesses of raw materials and commodities  may benefit from even more profits than those with finished branded  products. For example, PC component (chips and software) manufac turers thrive while Dell, Acer, and HP continue to struggle (Sheth, Uslay,  & Sisodia, 2020). While the common reactions to shortages (hoarding/  building reserves and consequently inflation) may initially exacerbate  the situation, we are hopeful that an alternative, more mindful paradigm  can emerge."
"Climate change and the rising scarcity of natural resources and  commodities necessitates marketers to be more mindful of consumption  (Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011). The Russo-Ukranian war has put  extraordinary strain on the supply chains and accelerated the need to  transform towards mindful marketing. Mindful (effective, efficient, and  ethical) marketing facilitates sustainable consumption by simulta neously considering the interests of buyers, sellers, and society at large  as primary stakeholders; in other words, people, planet, and profit (Apte  & Sheth, 2016; Malhotra, Lee, & Uslay 2012). Consideration of multiple  stakeholders prevents wasteful, unethical or dumb marketing practices  that result in over- or under-consumption, and helps to create enduring  customer value (Sheth & Sisodia, 2006b; Sheth & Uslay, 2022)."
"Similarly, entrepreneurial marketing is commonly employed by B2B  businesses and is uniquely suited to enhance firm performance, since it  has been observed and empirically found to be more impactful than  traditional approaches especially when the markets are turbulent (Alqah tani & Uslay, 2020; Alqahtani, Uslay, & Yeniyurt, 2023; Whalen et al.,  2016). Bringing entrepreneurial and mindfulness mindsets together can  also prove beneficial (Uslay & Erdogan, 2014). Necessity is the mother  of invention; thus, we fully expect dire circumstances and shortages to  2 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this keen observation."
J.N. Sheth and C. Uslay                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
"Journal of Business Research 166 (2023) 114120 5 lead to more innovation which is a natural product of mindful entre preneurship. New business applications in the US surged by 24% in 2020  and set an all-time-record while many existing businesses successfully  pivoted and adapted during the Covid-19 pandemic (Garcia et al., 2021)."
"There is a need for both conceptual frameworks as well as empirical  research on ad-hoc black swan events. Development of research pro grams with a historical perspective would be a welcome development in  B2B marketing research just like they have been impactful in manage ment (e.g., Carroll & Swaminathan, 2000). We offer ten research ques tions based on the eight consequences of a prolonged conflict in Ukraine."
"Admittedly, many of these questions cover key factors, relationships,  and mechanisms that are broad enough to serve as topics for multiple  dissertations."
"Can the argued U-shaped relationship between the level of compe tition and collaboration be empirically tested in B2B markets? What  are the key factors that drive this relationship?  How can alternative market mechanisms such as auctions, platform  markets, and peer-to-peer networks be used to mitigate the risks of  cartelization and facilitate competition?  How do the availability of critical inputs such as fertilizers and oil  affect the resilience and competitiveness of different B2B sectors, and  what are the implications for supply chain management and  strategy?  Which alternative sourcing strategies, such as local sourcing, vertical  integration, or diversification are more effective against supply chain  disruptions and lead to higher bargaining power?  What are the factors that impact the ability of firms in high value-add  sectors versus low value-add sectors to cope with inflation and rising  commodity prices, and what are the implications for industry  structure and performance?  What are the antecedents and outcomes of customer-driven (back ward) vertical integration in B2B markets, and (how) do these differ  from other forms of M&A activity?  How can tri-sector collaborations between the government, private  sector, and NGOs be structured to encourage innovative solutions  that address forthcoming shortages in essential resources?  What are the key drivers and barriers to the adoption of substitutes  for oil and gas, and how can publicprivate partnerships accelerate  the transition to alternative energy sources?  What role can bartering arrangements play in the development and  adoption of new technologies such as renewable energy and digital  currencies? What are the implications for sustainable development  and economic growth?  Can event history analysis be used to examine the impact of wars and  other conflicts on B2B markets?  In conclusion, the Russo-Ukrainian war has had far-reaching impact  for B2B markets and supply chains, prompting firms to adapt and seek  innovative solutions. The conflict has highlighted the importance of  improvisation and the development of new sourcing strategies. B2B  firms are actively diversifying their approaches to sourcing and  exploring alternative ingredients, components, and energy sources to  mitigate supply chains disruptions. This article focused on eight key  consequences of a prolonged conflict, shedding light on implications for  B2B markets and relationships. As the conflict progresses, it will be  crucial for businesses to remain agile, resilient, and proactive in navi gating the evolving landscape shaped by these geopolitical challenges."
"We certainly hope that our pessimistic expectation and concerns do not  come true, and that the Russo-Ukrainian conflict can be resolved soon."
"Alas, we already see varying levels of evidence for each of these con sequences, which increases our confidence in their relevance and the  need to prepare for them. Given the importance of economics in driving  politics, we hope B2B firms can aggregate their lobbying power and  connections and join the effort to market peace around the world (Kotler  (2022))."

"1. Introduction The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused considerable human suering and harmed global trade (Ruta 2022). According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global economic outlook has worsened since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, 2022, with trade growth pro- jected to fall from 4.7% to less than 3.4% (WTO 2022). Ukraine and Russia are major commodity exporters. Ukraine, in particular, ships most of its products by sea, and the conict has greatly limited this mode of transport. Russia, in contrast, faces substantial economic sanctions that im- pact the domestic economy and limits its ability to participate in global markets. Both mechanisms led to a worldwide reallocation of trade ows for commodities, such as base metals, mineral oils, and agricultural products (Borin et al. 2022; Bentley et al. 2022). This paper provides the rst ex-post empirical analysis of the global trade reallocation eects caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, using detailed trade data and theory-consistent empirical models to quantify the degree of trade destruction and diversion resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
"A growing literature investigates the economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. Studies have examined a range of topics, including economic growth (Mahlstein et al. 2022), stock market performance (Boungou and Yati e 2022), commodity markets (Fang and Shao 2022), and food security (Behnassi and El Haiba 2022; Carriquiry et al. 2022). Borin et al. (2022) developed a theoretical model to show that the extent of the economic eects depends on the ability of a country to diversify its supply chains. Ruta (2022) conducted an ex-ante simulation that predicts global trade to decrease by 1% in 2022, reducing the global gross domestic product by 0.7%. Other ex-ante studies have simulated the implications of economic sanctions on trade (Allen 2022; Estrada and Koutronas 2022), analyzed pre-war grain market trade dependencies (Glauben et al. 2022), and explored measures to ensure food security (Bentley et al. 2022). In an ex-post analysis for grain and oilseed trade, Ahn et al. (2023) nd that imports from Ukraine were 78.2% lower between February and July 2022. They show that the Ukraine-Russia war had substantial trade implications for the directly involved countries but only limited ones for global grain and oilseed markets."
The paper utilizes a product-level empirical model of bilateral trade to assess the ex-post trade eects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Drawing on recent contributions to the international 1 
"trade and policy literature (Arita et al. 2022; Steinbach 2022; Ahn et al. 2023), a counterfactual identication strategy is used that measures the trade destruction and diversion eects at the prod- uct and region levels. The estimates reveal that imports from Ukraine were 47.3% or $19.4 billion below the counterfactual level between February and August 2022. Reduced exports of agricultural commodities and base metals drive those trade losses. In contrast, Russia recorded trade grains that pushed imports 15.7% above the counterfactual. Higher mineral exports, which increased by more than $61.2 billion between February and August 2022, drove the trade gains. Russia realized those trade gains mainly with Asia, which imported more than $41.1 billion of additional prod- ucts. There is further evidence of trade diversion with countries other than Russia and Ukraine, particularly in South America, North America, Europe, and Africa, being most pronounced for agricultural commodities and mineral products. The ndings suggest that the Ukraine-Russia war had signicant trade implications for the directly involved countries but only limited ones for the global markets. Lastly, the empirical results prove that global market adjustments operated mainly through increased commodity prices."
"The paper makes two distinct contributions to the growing literature on the economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Firstly, it is the rst study to utilize counterfactual statistical methods to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on international trade. These ndings extend previous ex-ante studies on the trade eects of economic sanctions and trade blockages and ex-post studies on the product-specic trade eects (Allen 2022; Estrada and Koutronas 2022; Ahn et al. 2023). Secondly, the paper documents the global reallocation dynamics for dierent product groups and regions. It shows how the trade eects of the Russia-Ukraine war operate primarily through import price adjustments. These insights are essential, as earlier ex- ante simulation studies have warned of supply constraints and their implications for global markets (Bentley et al. 2022; Glauben et al. 2022; Ruta 2022)."
2. Empirical Strategy and Data This paper uses event study methods to examine the short-run global trade eects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
"The empirical strategy is based on the isomorphic gravity equation and recent developments in the eld of international trade, which allow for the identication of ex-post 2 "
"treatment dynamics and the evaluation of the global trade reallocation eects (Arita et al. 2022; Carter et al. 2022). A dynamic treatment model that includes leads and lags relative to the event of interest is utilized, enabling the capture of pre-trends and the assessment of post-treatment dynamics (Freyaldenhoven et al. 2021). The trade eects of the Russia-Ukraine war are quantied using a non-linear panel regression model for count data, as proposed by Steinbach (2022), with the following regression equation: yijpt = exp   ijp,mo + ijp,yr + 6 X m=6 mrijp,tm ! ijpt , (1) where i, j, p, and t represent the importer, exporter, product, and month, respectively."
"The outcome of interest is represented by yijpt, which maps into import value and unit value, while the multiplicative error term is represented by ijpt."
"It is assumed that all latent confounders are captured by the high-dimensional xed eects dened at the importer-exporter-product-event- month (ijp,mo) and importer-exporter-product-event-year (ijp,yr) levels. The model addresses dierences in import volumes through the importer-exporter-product-event-year xed eects and accounts for seasonal patterns in trade with importer-exporter-product-event-month xed eects."
"In addition, the xed eects account for unobserved trade costs, such as cultural, border, and proximity eects, and trade integration agreements (Carter et al. 2022). For instance, mineral oil and gas imports could face pre-existing trends and seasonality patterns in import values."
"The term P6 m=6 mrijp,tm measures the dynamic treatment eects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which occurred in February 2022 and serves as the center point of the event study. Trade data from 2017 to 2021 are used as the control group, following the counterfactual evaluation approach developed by Arita et al. (2022) and Steinbach (2022), who analyzed the trade eects of the coronavirus pandemic and the 2012/2022 U.S. container shipping disruptions, respectively."
"The Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimator is employed to identify the parameters of interest, with the iteratively re-weighted least-squares algorithm being utilized to account for the high-dimensional xed eects (Silva and Tenreyro 2006; Correia et al. 2020). Mullahy and Norton (2022) demonstrated that the Poisson estimator is more suitable than transforming the outcome when examining marginal eects. As the standard errors are suspected to be correlated at 3 "
"the importer-exporter-product level, they are clustered in this manner (Cameron and Miller 2015; Steinbach 2022)."
Detailed trade data at the Harmonized System (HS) chapter level (HS-2) were obtained from the Trade Data Monitor (2022).1 The nal balanced panel dataset consists of monthly import values and unit values for 107 reporting countries and 190 partner countries at the HS-chapter level from August 2017 to July 2022.2 The trade data are mirrored due to Russia ceasing the reporting of monthly trade statistics in February 2022.
"The event study panel is constructed using this dataset and allows for measuring the degree of trade destruction and diversion resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The nal panel includes 410,142 unique importer-exporter-product pairs imported under 99 HS chapters.3 3. Results Figure 1 presents event study estimates for the global trade eects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, comparing the import value and unit value eects for Ukraine, Russia, and the Rest of the World. Each subgure displays the dynamic treatment parameters, 95% condence intervals, and uniform sup-t bands for the event-time of the outcome, as described in Montiel Olea and Plagborg-Mller (2019) and Freyaldenhoven et al. (2021). The estimates for a static regression model are also shown, with test statistics for pre-trends and leveling-otreatment eects reported in the gure notes. The analysis found no statistically signicant pre-trends, indicating that the Russian invasion of Ukraine is exogenous to the outcomes of interest (Freyaldenhoven et al. 2019; Sun and Abraham 2021; Roth 2022). Given the use of importer-exporter-product-event-year and importer-exporter-product-event-month xed eects, the treatment group exhibits similar trends in the pre-treatment period to the control groups, validating the research design. At the same time, there is limited evidence for leveling-otreatment eects for Ukraine and Russia, but some 1 Appendix Table A.1 maps the HS chapters to sections and provides product descriptions."

evidence for the Rest of the World.
"The estimation results indicate that imports from Ukraine experienced a signicant decline of 47.3% from February to August 2022.4 This decrease in trade can be attributed to adverse eects that accumulated until March 2022, leading to a persistent depression of imports from Ukraine at -55.5% of the counterfactual level from April to August 2022. In contrast, the analysis reveals positive post-event treatment eects for Russia and other countries. The average trade eect for Russia was 15.7%, while it was 11.2% for all other countries.5 Imports from Russia experienced a notable increase of 20.8% above the counterfactual level from March to June 2022, although economic sanctions subsequently reduced these trade gains to statistically insignicant levels. The analysis also found signicant unit value eects, with unit values for imports from Ukraine, Russia, and other countries being 12.8%, 18.8%, and 3.2% higher, respectively. Because the average post-event trade eect is larger for the unit value specication (18.8%) than for the value specication (15.7%), there is some evidence for trade destruction in volume terms for Russia. In contrast, the increase in unit values for Ukraine suggests that Ukrainian exporters continued exporting higher-priced varieties while reducing exports of lower-valued products."
"Figure 2 shows dierences in the average post-event trade eects and Figure 3 the corresponding trade gains and losses by HS section. Starting with Ukraine, there is signicant heterogeneity in the treatment eects across HS sections, with the largest average post-event trade eects observed for arms and ammunition (Section 19, -91.0%), animal and vegetable fats (Section 3, -71.0%), and base metals (Section 15, -67.0%). In terms of trade value, imports from Ukraine were $19.4 billion below the counterfactual between February and August 2022, with the largest trade losses occurring in vegetable products (Section 2, -$5.3 billion), base metals (Section 15, -$5.5 billion), and animal and vegetable fats (Section 3, -$4.3 billion). In contrast, Russia experienced signicantly smaller 4 The average post-event trade eects were calculated using the formula "
"5 Appendix Figure A.1 presents robustness checks for potential pre-trends. Under the assumption that pre-trends would have continued linearly in the post-treatment period, we estimate Equation 1 following the approach outlined in Dobkin et al. (2018). The results show no evidence of signicant linear pre-trend eects for Ukraine and Russia."
"When accounting for these pre-trends, the average post-event trade eects for Ukraine, Russia, and the Rest of the World are -48.4%, -3.3%, and -2.8%, respectively. These results suggest that the main estimates likely represent the upper bound of the treatment eect range."

"adverse trade eects, with arms imports (Section 19) from Russia decreasing the most with -68.2%."
"However, this estimate is statistically insignicant at conventional levels. At the same time, imports of Russian mineral products (Section 5) saw a 31.7% increase above the counterfactual level between February and August 2022, resulting in $68.3 billion in additional imports from Russia. Without the higher energy imports, trade with Russia would have been $7.1 billion lower during this period."
"Lastly, the Rest of Section World experienced no signicant adverse trade disruptions, with imports of arms and ammunition (Section 19) growing by 51.4%, followed by mineral products (Section 5, 47.2%) and footwear (Section 12, 35.6%). The substantial increase in imports of mineral products can be attributed to the post-Covid trade recovery and positive commodity price eects due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.6 The average post-event treatment eects and estimated trade gains and losses by region are pre- sented in Figure 4. South America, Africa, and Asia experienced the largest reduction in imports from Ukraine, with declines of 79.6%, 78.8%, and 72.9%, respectively, between February and Au- gust 2022. In terms of import value for Ukraine, Asia saw the most considerable reduction at $12.3 billion, followed by Europe ($4.0 billion) and Africa ($1.5 billion). Lower imports of agricultural products and base metal drove the decrease in imports. In contrast, Asia (26.7%) and Europe (11.3%) increased their imports from Russia beyond the counterfactual level. The most substan- tial trade gains were seen for Russian exports to Asia ($41.1 billion) and Europe ($18.1 billion), while Russia experienced trade losses of $2.3 billion in North America. Higher imports of mineral products drove the increase in Russian exports.7 There is evidence of trade diversion with coun- tries other than Russia and Ukraine beyond the counterfactual level, particularly in North America (18.5%), Asia (7.6%), and Europe (7.5%)."
"6 Appendix Figure A.2 depicts estimates of the average post-event trade eects for the unit value. Mineral products (Section 5) were 22.4% more expensive than under the counterfactual scenario. Similar patterns are observed for animal and vegetable fats (Section 3, 10.2%) and stone products (Section 13, 8.5%)."
"7 Appendix Figure A.3 shows that higher commodity prices contributed to Russian trade gains in Europe. In contrast, Asian countries also signicantly expanded their import volume, particularly Russian oil and gas. All other regions considerably reduced imports of Russian products."

"4. Conclusion This paper investigates the reallocation of global trade in response to the Russia-Ukraine war using detailed trade data and theory-consistent empirical models. The analysis utilizes counterfactual evaluation methods and nds that Ukraine experienced signicant export disruptions. Compared with the counterfactual, imports from Ukraine were 47.3% lower between February and August 2022. In contrast, Russia experienced a more negligible impact from the war, realizing signicant trade gains in Europe and Asia reinforced by higher prices for mineral products."
"The Russia- Ukraine war resulted in considerable trade diversion, beneting countries in North America and Europe. Notably, the adjustment of global trade is primarily driven by commodity price hikes, with substantial heterogeneity observable across product groups and regions."
The ex-ante analysis suggests that the Ukraine-Russia war had signicant but heterogeneous im- plications for the directly involved countries but only limited eects on global markets for most commodities.
"The results also indicate that economic sanctions imposed by Western countries against Russia were slow to limit Russian exports of mineral oils and other products. The consider- able trade diversion is due to non-compliance with nancial sanctions by Russian trading partners in Asia, Europe, and South America. In addition, the empirical ndings point toward persistent trade disruptions for Ukraine in agricultural products and base metals, highlighting the economic and political importance of regaining foreign market access for Ukrainian exporters."
Further work might study how aected rms adjusted their supplier and customer networks in response to the trade disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
"Trade costs are instrumental in forming such networks, implying that the trade shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine war may induce long-term and heterogeneous disruptions to those networks that vary with proximity and rm characteristics (Bernard and Moxnes 2018). Lastly, while this research speaks to the foreign trade response to the Russia-Ukraine war, an additional adjustment mechanism worth exploring is the domestic price response to the armed conict (Korovkin and Makarin 2023)."

Data were collected in the spring and summer of 2022 through  survey questionnaires and interviews. The results of the research reveal that a) this wave of migration from  Ukraine is overwhelmingly female; b) women are often migrating with children, which makes arranging  appropriate childcare and school placement essential to their entry into the destination workforce; c) Ukrainian  labor migration patterns before the war have had a significant impact on current flows; d) Ukrainian refugees to  Poland and Germany often want to be able to travel regularly back to Ukraine; this affects their willingness to  apply for temporary protection schemes that oblige them to remain in destination countries, which in turn makes  it difficult to precisely quantify the number of refugees in a given country."
"1. Introduction1  The movement of forced migrants and refugees fleeing from the war  in Ukraine that began in February 2022 represents Europe's most sig nificant wave of migration since World War II. At least 7 million people  are estimated to have left the country in 2022 (Statista report on Russia-  Ukraine conflict 2021-2022 - Statistics & facts, 2023). A similar number  are internally displaced, having moved from war zones in the south and  east towards western Ukraine. The number of international and internal  migrants likely exceeds 1214 million (United Nations High Commis sioner on Human Rights, n.d.; United Nations High Commissioner on  Human Rights, 2022). This is more than a quarter of the country's  population of 44 million. This paper puts this movement of Ukrainians in  a historical perspective, describing patterns of movement to and from  Ukraine during the Soviet period and in the aftermath of the collapse of  the Soviet Union (Karpova, 2005; Malynovska et al., 2005; Vollmer &  Malynovska, 2016). These earlier patterns, particularly circular labor  migration patterns to Poland and neighboring European countries after  1991, set the stage for patterns we see today."
"This article has three objectives. First, it describes the migration of  Ukrainian refugees to Poland and Germany, focusing on who the mi grants are and how the reception of refugees has differed in these two  countries. Second, it highlights the impact of the feminized nature of this  migration on the concerns and decision-making of refugees, including  whether they apply for asylum. Third, it begins to explore how the fact  that many women are traveling with children  usually but not always  their own  affects their needs upon arrival and their ability to meet the  challenges of resettlement."
"Scholars writing since February 2022 emphasize the distinctive  character of this war and the difficulties it creates for classification and  analysis (Yekelchyk, 2022). This paper uses a descriptive-explorative  approach to data collection and analysis, focusing on defining the  major characteristics of war-induced displacement from Ukraine. We  focus on Ukrainian migration to Poland and Germany in 2022. The sit uation on the ground remains fluid as migration patterns respond to an  evolving military conflict. For example, Russia's targeting of energy  infrastructure in autumn and winter 202223 led refugees who hoped to  return to Ukraine to delay their return. This research should therefore be  * Corresponding author."

Womens Studies International Forum 99 (2023) 102756 2 taken as a snapshot of the situation one year into this bloody and tragic  war.
We do not know exactly who is crossing the border into Ukraine. Is it  women who fled but left their elderly parents behind? Are they volun teers delivering humanitarian aid? Or so-called pendulum labor mi grants who go back and forth every few weeks or months to work? Are  the returnees returning for good or just visiting? Our survey of Ukrainian  migrants to Poland and Germany tried to answer these questions.
An essential feature of this migration is that people who have left  Ukraine often go back and forth over the border for various reasons.
"Border checkpoint data captures only the number of people entering and  out of the country. This explains the otherwise mystifying data updated  daily on the UNHCR website: as of 17 January 2023, 7,977,980 refu gees from Ukraine [were] recorded across Europe. 4,940,057 were  registered for Temporary Protection or similar national protection  schemes in Europe.2 Scrolling down on the UNHCR Operational Data  Portal for the Ukraine Refugee Situation, one finds that there have been  17,688,845 border crossings from Ukraine since February 2022 to  February 2023; and 9,585,700 border crossings into Ukraine over the  same period."
"Our study draws on two streams of literature. The first concerns the  feminization of migration, a concept that originated in broader studies  of migration and labor migration (Sassen, 2000; Jones, 2008; Piper,  2008a, 2008b; Paiewonsk, 2009). The second includes studies and re ports that discuss the demographics, needs, and concerns of war-forced  migrants (CMR Spotlights, 2022, 2023; Juran & Broer, 2017; Ambrosini  et al., 2019). War-related migration has historically been associated  with young men seeking to avoid military conscription; these men would  be first to depart, later sending money home or attempting to reunite  their families (Dragostinova, 2016). Feminist scholars pointed out that  war and migration too have been generally analyzed and understood as  male domains and argued for a change in focus (Haleh, 2007). To  bridge these two streams, we offer a historical perspective that argues  that Ukrainian migration to Europe before the war shaped later migra tion patterns. As with other studies (Goodman et al., 2017), we found it  difficult to operationalize the formal legal definition of a refugee. Given  that our interest in this paper is in exploring major features of female-  dominated displacement rather than the legal definition of a refugee  per se, we use the terms refugee, forced migrant, and war-induced  migrant interchangeably."
"Throughout history, women have migrated in significant num berssometimes more than men and from different countries. Migra tion flows to Italy from Ukraine, Cape Verde, and 13 of 30 Latin  American countries, for example, have been dominated by women. In  the Philippines and Sri Lanka in the 2000s, women constituted the  majority among those who moved abroad to work or to live. In the early  2000s, more than half of Indonesians who migrated for work were  women. Similarly, Central and South American women accounted for  the majority of migrants to Spain. And Caribbean women migrants have  outnumbered men in moving to North America since the 1950s (Caritas,  2012)."
"When researchers refer to the feminization of migration, they are not  just flagging the increasing share of women in migration flows. Female  migration is not the same as male migration, and it is evolving. Women  refugees are among the most vulnerable of migrants. They may be vic tims of violence, sometimes systematic, including rape and assault, and  they often migrate with their children (Regional Representation for  Central Europe & United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights,  2008; Bhuyan et al., 2016; Malakooti & Davin, 2015). But only a mi nority of displaced women are granted refugee status (Harris, 2000)."
"Due to the weaker position of women and girls in their home country,  they frequently lack the means to travel and may not know enough  about their rights or have the skills to complete the bureaucratic  application process (Regional Representation for Central Europe &  United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2008). More and  more women are migrating independently as breadwinners instead of  following their husbands or male relatives as family dependents (Elm hirst, 2007; Leal et al., 2019; Piper & Yamanaka, 2005). The scale of  these changes and their impact, in particular for children and other  family members left behind, has received increasing attention world wide and in Ukraine."
"Before the war, research on feminization of migration flows from  different countries including Ukraine concentrated on changing  employment and demographic trends in destination countries as a pull  factor. Later on the focus shifted to specific gendered experiences of  female migrants (see: Harney, 2011; Kindler, 2011; Mudrak, 2011;  Solari, 2017; Volodko, 2011, 2015). More recent literature has exam ined new phenomena like the so-called social care or social gap,  mobility orphans and grandmothering (Fedyuk, 2016; Vollmer &  Malynovska, 2016; Kupets, 2016). These studies also highlighted the  risk of human trafficking these women were facing (Kindler, 2011;  Caritas, 2012). Our study develops this line of research further by  looking at one of the first war-forced wave of migration from Ukraine."
"This study builds on the broader paradigm and considers women's  subjectivities to supplement descriptive (Vang et al., 2016)."
"2. Results and discussion  This paper examines the demographic characteristics, migration  journey, and concerns of Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Germany (see  Table 1). The research was undertaken in early March 2022 as the first  waves of war refugees fled from Ukraine. The data were collected on-site  at refugees reception points (CAPI) and online (CAWI) (Isa nski et al.,  2022). In June a similar survey was run in Germany; in depth interviews  were conducted MaySeptember 2022 in both Poland and Germany."
"Trained interviewers conducted 523 surveys at Polish reception centers  for Ukrainian refugees in Ukrainian (413), Russian (77), and English  (42). The questionnaire asked respondents about their education, lan guage proficiency, and professional experience as well as about their  plans, needs and concerns. In Germany 571 respondents answered in  Ukrainian (399) or Russian (172). Semi-structured interviews were then  conducted MayJune 2022 with 22 displaced Ukrainians in Poland (18  women, 4 men) and in MaySeptember 2022 with 10 displaced Ukrai nians in Germany (9 women, 1 man). Intertwined respondents were  chosen based on their agreement to participate in further study during  the survey. The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee  of the Department of Sociology, Adam Mickiewicz University (Pozna n,  Poland), with special attention paid to the fact that research subjects  belonged to the vulnerable group of displaced persons (see Table 1)."
"Polish survey respondents had worked in many professions, with  several reporting multiple occupational categories. 14 % of respondents  were entrepreneurs or IT specialists. A quarter had previously worked as  scientists, engineers, and health or education specialists. The Ukrainians  in Poland were somewhat less highly skilled than those in Germany but  many of those interviewed were professionals (21 % in Poland vs. 44 %  in Germany), white-collar workers (12 % in Poland vs. 26 % in Ger many), or had service skills (27 % in Poland) in high demand (see sec tion below for details). Ten percent, for example, had hotel and  2 All EU Member States have implemented the Temporary Protection Direc tive which offers expedited stay, residence and work status for Ukrainian citi zens and eligible Ukrainian residents leaving Ukraine. The Directive applies to  Ukrainian citizens; foreign citizens residents in Ukraine; and spouses or part ners, minor children, and cohabiting dependent family members of these in dividuals resident in Ukraine on or before February 24, 2022. However, EU  Member States may introduce variations in the scope of support provided, scope  of eligible applicants and local application processes. In Germany, applicants  are registered in a specific place and changing location is difficult. If a person  applies for the asylum, s/he will be assigned to a Federal L ander (state); each  county has fixed admission quotas designed to ensure a fair distribution of  asylum seekers among Federal L ander. The asylum seeker is obliged to remain  in that state over the course of the asylum process, which may last years."

About 16 % of respondents had worked as per sonal caregivers or domestic staff, and 19 % had been drivers, farmers,  construction, or sales workers. The most commonly spoken foreign  language among adult refugees surveyed was English: 26 % said they  were fluent and another 18 % claimed elementary knowledge; Polish  was second with 3 % fluent and 12 % having elementary skills. 6 % of  adults claimed some knowledge of German, 7 % of Italian, and 3 % of  French."
"Respondents interviewed in Germany in June had similar charac teristics: three-quarters were women; 54 % had traveled with children;  15 % were over 60 years old; 79 % had higher education and 13 % had  completed vocational training. The findings are consistent with the re sults of a survey conducted by the German government in March 2022,  in which 86 % of respondents were women; 55 % arrived with children;  and 6 % were over 60 years old. 73 % had higher education and 19 %  had vocational education; 64 % were previously employed and another  22 % were self-employed (German Federal Ministry of the Interior and  Homeland (BMI), 2022). In terms of previous employment, the top three  sectors included management (15 % of respondents), education (15 %),  service (8 %), and 17 % were self-employed. 19 % said they knew some  English, though 13 % categorized their proficiency as basic; 13 % knew  German (12 % basic), and 5 % knew Polish (4 % basic)."
"Before discussing these populations in detail, a few words about how  two countries, Poland and Germany, have met the challenge of Ukrai nian forced migration. We focus on these countries because they have  received the highest number of Ukrainian refugees since the full-scale  war began in February 2022. Of the roughly 5 million Ukrainian refu gees in Europe, 1.5 million are in Poland and about 1 million are in  Germany (United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2023)."
"Poland and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and before the full-  scale war, and Poland hosted Europe's most extensive Ukrainian labor  migration diaspora. Germany was the leading destination for Ukrainian  asylum seekers. Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and espe cially after the full-scale attack in February 2022 triggered solidarity and  spontaneous aid initiatives for Ukrainian refugees in both Poland and  Germany (Duszczyk & Kaczmarczyk, 2022; Isa nski et al., 2022; Sereda  et al., 2022; Staniszewski, 2022)."
"2.1. The response in Poland  According to Polish Border Guard data, in the first year of the war,  over 9.5 million people crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border into Poland  (UNHCR data portal), with over 100,000 crossing each day at the peak  in MarchApril 2022. During the first days of the war, thousands of  volunteers and NGOs rushed to the border to offer material aid to the  arriving refugees. A report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the human  rights of migrants noted in July that authorities in Poland worked to  simplify procedures and maximize border entry capacity to facilitate the  speedy entry of refugees. Reception centers and a first-point contact  network were set up to address medical and humanitarian needs and  provide transportation and accommodation information (Morales,  2022)."
"The arrival into Poland was often a huge relief for the Ukrainians,  who had been waiting in lines, in the cold, often without food, water or  toilets for up to 12 h. One woman now in Poland explained what it was  like to approach the border:  We got out of the taxi and saw this huge line. The queue was several  kilometers long There were bio-toilets, and Polish volunteers  entered Ukrainian territory and pitched tents. They kept us warm."
"They offered us instant noodles, tea, and all sorts of bars. The chil dren were very happy. There was fire and blankets. We lasted from  12 am to 5 am in this terrible cold.  Aid originally organized privately became institutionalized in the  first weeks. Private individuals, NGOs and local authorities worked to  coordinate their efforts. In cities relatively close to the Polish border,  such as Lublin, city officials volunteered to help the forced migrants  (Baszczak et al., 2022). The Polish parliament responded to the influx of  refugees by passing an Act on Assistance for Ukrainian nationals in  March 2022. The act allowed Ukrainian residents to register for a PESEL  (the Polish acronym for Universal Electronic System for Registration of  the Population) ID number from mid-April. Once registered, they were  allowed to legally stay in Poland for 18 months, work, and get access to  free health care. (Previously, one had to be temporarily or permanently  in Poland for over three months to get a PESEL number). Ukrainian  children could go to school free of charge. Arriving Ukrainians were also  eligible for other social benefits, including a monthly child allowance of  105 euros (PLN 500) per child, the same as Polish children (Morales,  2022). Over 950,000 Ukrainian refugees received one-off cash payments  of approximately 64 Euros (PLN 300) per person and free in-kind  assistance (e.g. clothes, hygiene products, food, internet cards) during  the first month of their stay in Poland. The law also transferred funds to  municipalities that were used to reimburse Poles for expenses if they  provided food and housing to Ukrainian refugees at a rate of 8.6 Euros  (PLN 40) for up to 120 days (Polish Economic Institute, 2022). Ukrai nians were also given access to free public transportation (railways,  buses, city trams). By the end of 2022, the Polish government was on  track to have spent $8.3 billion on housing and other support for  Table 1  Demographic characteristics of refugees surveyed in Poland and Germany."

"Yet it was not only the Polish NGOs, local authorities, and govern ment that stepped up to help Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland."
"Humanitarian and international organizations set up warming tents and  stations where refugees could get hot food, information, medical  attention, and rides into Poland. By the beginning of March, the Inter national Organization for Migration (IOM) had set up nine Reception  Centers along the border to provide support to refugeesUkrainians and  often overlooked non-Ukrainians  including legal counseling and help  finding accommodations (IOM, 2022a). Within a week, the IOM was  also providing wheelchairs, laundry machines, baby baths, clothing, and  mobile charging stations (IOM, 2022b). However, their presence was  incomparably smaller than the response of local civil society and self-aid  groups."
"Poles also responded personally to the crisis (Staniszewski, 2022). By  the end of July, the UN estimated that over 2 million Ukrainians were  staying in private Polish homes (Isa nski et al., 2022; Morales, 2022). By  April, one in 8 respondents in the bordering south-east Podkarpackie  region reported that they had provided housing to Ukrainian refugees  (Polish Economic Institute, 2022). The border town of Rzesz ow had  already grown by over 50 %, Gdansk and Katowice by over 30 %. After a  month of the war, the population of Warsaw had grown by 15 %,  reaching 2 million souls for the first time (Fusiek, 2022; Union of Polish  Metropolies, 2022). A survey of 2200 Poles by the Polish Economic  institute in the spring found that over 70 % of respondents reported that  they had helped Ukrainian refugees during the first months of the crisis;  59 % had purchased essential items for them, 53 % donated money,  1720 % volunteered to help sort out problems, 7 % said they made their  home or uninhabited properties available to refugees, 6 % helped find  employment and 5 % organized transport from the border (Polish Eco nomic Institute, 2022)."
"The warmth of the Poles waiting just across the border was evident to  a 29-year old Ukrainian woman as she crossed the border:   I saw crowds of volunteers who ran to meet us. They grabbed bags,  children, helped old people and women with children. They invited  me to the heating point, there was hot food, tea, coffee, sandwiches."
"For small children there were diapers, formula, there were strollers  for babies. There were also Red Cross tents where you could get  medical help. There was a lot of attention and care.  We wanted to understand what Ukrainian refugees who had settled  in Poland and Germany needed, and asked respondents to list their most  urgent needs (see Tables 2 and 3). Ukrainian refugees in Poland listed  material assistance like food and clothing (57 % of respondents),  housing (29 %), and medical care (9 %) (Isa nski et al., 2022). The fact  that housing was a concern for only a third of respondents suggests that  they had already managed to secure reliable shelter. Respondents were  concerned about finding a job, but much less so than their compatriots in  Germany (see Tables 2 and 3)."
"Although the 2022 wave of Ukrainian arrivals to Poland was driven  by war rather than a search for labor, finding work was a priority for  many. Legally employed Ukrainians pay into the social security system  (ZUS). Before the war, some 627,000 Ukrainians were registered in the  ZUS database (Mrugaa & Tomczyk, 2022: 9). In 2022, over half a  million Ukrainians registered with the system, 66.8 % of whom were  women. Most of these women (72.3 %) had temporary work, a number  lower than that of men only 58 % of men had temporary work, with the  rest permanently employed. December statistics showed that 766,000  Ukrainians, both labor migrants and refugees, were officially employed  in Poland (Nowosielska & Otto, 2022)."
In-depth interviews allow us to look behind promising statistics.
"Almost all our respondents in Poland told us that they already had PESEL  IDs and some work. In many cases, however, the work was low-skilled,  low-paid, and difficult. One 29-year old woman in Poland described how  she is employed: We work at a factory that makes soft upholstery for  sofas and armchairs.  The work is hard, there is too much dust, it is  very difficult to breathe there, but since we need money, we agreed to  this work. We work from 14:00 to 19:00 every day.  We are registered  officially, we pay taxes. But now we also took on additional work at  night, as security guards.  A shortage of school openings for Ukrainian children led the Polish  government to allow classes taught in Ukrainian, which created jobs for  Ukrainian refugees with experience in education. There is also work for  support teachers hired in classes taught in Polish but with Ukrainian  children. But many Ukrainian refugees have trouble finding employ ment that corresponds to their skills (see Fig. 1)."
"Sometimes, the refugees dont know how to apply for jobs for which  Table 2  Self-reported most urgent needs of respondents in Poland and in Germany."

My friend  translated [my CV] into Polish  After a while, I also got a call from a company which offered me a job  with refugees because I had also worked as a journalist for many years.  Another important issue, finding childcare for younger children, has  also proven to be an obstacle to entering the job market and sometimes  leads Ukrainians to consider returning home.

If I had a mother, a sister, or at least a  husband here, I would know that he was under supervision  2.2. The response in Germany  According to the UNHCR data portal, Germany is hosting just over  one million Ukrainian refugees, the second largest population of  Ukrainian displaced persons. Of this million, 815,134 had registered for  Temporary Protection status as of November 2022, which entitled them  to social benefits, medical care and accommodation, as well as access to  schools, the labor market and integration courses (Dvell, 2022). TP  status is valid for 1 year but can be extended for up to 3 years. German  Interior Minister Nancy Faeser stated in October that 70 % of adult ar rivals were women, and one third were teenagers and children. Finding  enough housing for everyone has proved to be a challenge (Grieshaber,  2022)."
"Like Poland, Germany experienced a surge of arrivals in early March  and April 2022. Many reported that they had not prepared to flee and  had to be persuaded to go by family members or men who were staying  to fight. A 72-year-old woman who had arrived in Germany described  what had happened in her family as follows: He [my son] joined the  territorial defense. He came and told us, pack up and run away! I  started to cry. Where to? My daughter and I really didn't want to go. We  don't know anything there. Because Germany does not share a border  with Ukraine, the refugees arrived from Poland with a lag. Non-  governmental organizations and individuals mobilized to meet Ukrai nian refugees at train stations and help them with translation, food,  clothes, housing, medical and psychological services, legal assistance,  and other support. As in Poland, civil society was first to respond, with  state and local governments joining the effort later. As of June, Ukrai nians were eligible to receive monthly payments of around 400 Euros  per person (DW, 2022) (see Table 4)."
"Given that they too were looking to find work quickly, as in Poland,  Ukrainian refugees in Germany headed to the largest cities. Germany  allocates each of its 16 states (lander) a quota for refugees, who are  distributed across the country according to an algorithm that takes into  account each state's population and tax revenue. Nonetheless, by  September 2022, 12 of Germany's 16 states reported that they were at  their breaking point (Glucroft, 2022)."
"Whereas the Polish government prioritized reimbursing receiving  families, the German government provided benefits directed to dis placed Ukrainians, including free transportation and medical insurance,  social housing (or subsidized rent), monthly welfare benefits of about  450 euros and an additional payment for each child. Children are  allowed  indeed obligated  to attend school though there are no na tional guidelines governing how they are placed. In some of Germany's  16 states, children need to attend welcome classes before they can go  to regular German schools. In others, they are placed in special prepa ratory classes for up to a year, while still others had the children start  German school immediately. By December 2022, 201,000 Ukrainian  children had been integrated into German schools, but demand still  Fig. 1. Prior work-related experience of respondents in Poland and Germany."
"Note that questions on skills and jobs were not identical in the Polish and  German surveys. We therefore report skills for the 330 respondents in Poland,  and prior employment for the 390 respondents in Germany."

"In both Poland and Germany, children thus become the main factor  around which refugees' adaptation strategies are structured. Young  women without children are also pulled into the problem of providing  childcare. Many traveled as helpers or mediators with women who are  distantly related, friends, or godchildren. Women leaving Ukraine often  offered to take the children of family members or friends who were  staying. A 35-year old woman in Germany recounted, As they began  shelling around Kyiv, I was afraid for [my] child.  I called [his]  godfather to tell him that I am leaving tomorrow and l could take my  god-child. She didn't want to go at first, but I came to them, we talked,  consulted and she went with us. She is already 16 years old. The ties  between separated family members end up shaping women's strategies  in the hosting countries. And once anchored by children, it will be more  difficult for refugees to return home. Consider the perspective of a 42-  year old Ukrainian mother in Germany,  In this school, no one spoke Ukrainian or Russian. Russian was only  spoken by 1-2 female teachers at the school, but they did not teach in  the classroom. Today, my son speaks English fluently and he is  starting to speak German so confidently. Therefore, I understand that  this is a huge plus for his education. In March, my language course  ends and I plan to return to Ukraine .... I plan to leave the little one  here for a year so that he can learn German.   Those receiving temporary protection status are allowed to work but  finding work has proven challenging for Ukrainian refugees in Germany."
"Those with inadequate German language proficiency must take six  months of integration language courses, which delays their entrance  to the job market. In the long term this may help the newly arrived gain  the necessary language skills, but it is less efficient than the Polish sys tem which demands only that those who arrive register for a PESEL  number before looking for work. A 42-year old woman explained that,  Job prospects are such that if you want to work not in some simple  job, such as a cashier in a supermarket or a cleaner you need to  have a language level of B-A, both English and German. . That is  also not easy. For example, I can only work part-time now. because  my language course starts at 1:45 p.m. and it takes me about 40  minutes to get there. And the course lasts until 18:00.  By October 2022, 51,000 Ukrainians had found jobs, 17,000 had  part-time positions, and 423,000 had registered as looking for employ ment in Germany (German Federal Work Agency, 2022). Our survey  suggests that the slow uptake of jobs is explained by the need to acquire  language proficiency, slower bureaucracy, and the difficulty of placing  children into kindergartens and schools. The option for female migrants  to take a 34-hour Migrant Women Simply Strong in Daily Life class to  practice their German and talk about their daily life (German Federal  Office for Migration and Refugees, 2022) may seem far out of reach, as a  41-year old mother explained. I could not go to the courses, because I  had no one to leave my children with. And we lived in such a village that  there were no courses in our village, so we had to go 40 km away for  these courses. And here's the thing, you understand that you can live in  this village and adapt somehow, but you can't grow and develop  somewhere.  Some Ukrainian refugees are not interested in acquiring the Tem porary Protection status that would allow them to receive benefits  because it limits their ability to travel back to Ukraine. Germany re quires that TP migrants in Germany register in a specific state and mu nicipality; once they do it is very difficult to move, even within  Germany. Someone who moves to a different municipality without  permission cannot receive social welfare benefits. Thus, unregistered  migrants who take advantage of the 90-day visa-free travel regime are  more mobile but do not receive benefits."
"Though it is difficult to directly compare, it seems that Germans has  been somewhat less receptive to Ukrainian migrants than Poles. Our  June survey found that a quarter of respondents had experienced some  discrimination from the local Russian-speaking diaspora, with only 5 %  reporting hostility from other groups. As the war drags on, support for  Ukrainian refugees across Europe may flag, driven partly by a Russian  propaganda effort (Morris & Oremus, 2022). A quarterly survey of Eu ropean public opinion found that 77 % of Europeans are willing to  accept Ukrainian refugees in their country though the number varies by  country, with Spain being the most receptive and France the least  (though still at 72 %). In Germany, readiness to accept Ukrainian refu gees has declined from 86 % in March to 74 % in September (Hoffman,  2022)."
"2007 surveys in Europe revealed a high level of openly-expressed  xenophobia towards refugees (Regional Representation for Central  Europe & United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2008)."
However contemporary surveys of European citizens show a markedly  different attitude towards accepting refugees now compared to attitudes  during previous refugee crises: only 3 % of Poles and 4 % of Germans  surveyed state that Ukrainians should not be admitted to their countries.
"Compare that to the 13 % of Poles and 6 % of Germans who had said that  no Syrian refugees should be allowed into their countries (Drazanova &  Geddes, 2022). Ukrainians in Europe have, for the most part, been met in  receiving countries with solidarity that is visibly higher than what was  extended to previous waves of refugees."
"This may be partly explained by the cultural affinity of Europeans  with Ukrainians, but it is also likely due to the fact that most of the  Ukrainians arriving in Europe are women. Previous studies of civic  engagement and social integration of refugees in Germany have shown  that female refugees tend to be more engaged in a wide range of activ ities offered by receiving communities including leisure activities, lan guage lessons, sports and art lessons, and counseling on everyday issues."
"These activities not only help them legalize and receive social benefits  faster, but also help create new social networks and practice of a new  language through informal interactions (Barreto et al., 2022). The  feminization of Ukrainian displacement may thus have created addi tional ground for solidarity and interaction with receiving communities."
"2.3. Ukrainian migration to Europe before 2014, and between 2014 and  2022  While the media has focused on the mass exodus and internal  displacement of Ukrainians since Russia invaded in February 2022,  Ukrainians have been actively moving within the Eurasian and Euro pean space for over a century (Fedyuk & Kindler, 2016). What has  changed is the nature of this migration. Prior to 2014, migration from  Ukraine was employment-driven. Estimates of the number of Ukrainians  who worked abroad in the last two decades vary from 2 to 5 million  based on populations surveyed and methodologies that attempt to  calculate the number of workers missing from the local labor market  (State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSS), 2009; State Statistics Service of  Ukraine (SSS), 2013). Surveys suggested that on average 70 % were  male and most were married. Only one destination, Italy, was dominated  by female labor migrants. A survey of female labor migrants in Italy  found that only 6 % had no children; over 75 % had left one or two  children in Ukraine, while 8 % had left three or more children behind  (Malynovska et al., 2005). The same survey found that most migrants  had completed secondary school or vocational training."
"2014 was a critical year in Ukrainian history. In February, Russian  troops invaded and occupied Crimea. In April, Russia began supporting  separatist movements in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, touching  off a civil war that had claimed 14,000 lives by 2022. At least 2.8 million  people were displaced according to a needs assessment conducted in  Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts; 1.7 million people had registered as  internally displaced, about one million had moved to Russia, and some  100,000 moved to nearby countries where they registered as refugees or  labor migrants (Vakhitova & Iavorskyi, 2020)."
Russia had been the most popular destination for Ukrainian labor  J. Andrews et al.
"Womens Studies International Forum 99 (2023) 102756 7 migrants in 2012 but ceased to be after 2014 (Pienkowski, 2020). In  contrast, political ties with EU strengthened. After the EU-Ukraine As sociation Agreement (AA) was signed and came into force, labor  migration between Ukraine and Europe became easier."
"Receiving asylum in the EU remained very difficult, however. The  number of Ukrainians applying for asylum in the EU was rather small,  peaking at around 22,000 in 2015 (a 20-fold increase over 2013  numbers) before falling to under 10,000 in the next three years (IOM,  2019), and then dropping to just over 5000 in 2020 and 2021 as the  conflict in Ukraine stabilized. Between 2013 and 2021, 16,100 Ukrai nians were granted asylum in EU member states. Importantly, across the  EU, the share of female to male asylum seekers (47.4 % female vs 51.6 %  male) increased relative to the proportion among labor migrants. In  Germany, the ratio resembled the average (48.4 % female to 51.5 %  male), whereas in Poland the ratio was slightly more skewed towards  men at 43.7 % female vs 56.1 % male (Eurostat, 2022)."
"The number of Ukrainians applying for asylum in Europe before  2022 was far less than the number of those traveling to Russia or Eu ropean countries for work. This was not, however, the narrative put  forth by Polish and Hungarian politicians trying to rebuff European calls  for them to accept more Syrian refugees. In 2016, for example, Polish  Prime Minister Beata Szydlo rejected the refugee quota assigned by the  EU, telling the European Parliament that Poland had taken instead a  million Ukrainian refugees. The real number was under ten (Dziennik  Gazeta, 2016). Meanwhile, the number of residence permits issued to  Ukrainians for employment skyrocketed from 387,000 in 2014 to 1.7  million in 2017 (IOM Ukraine, 2019). Viktor Orban's government in  Hungary solved a labor shortage by privileging Ukrainian labor migrants  and then using them as an excuse not to accept Syrians (Pancevski,  2019). Ukrainian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity even received Hun garian citizenship."
"In short, Ukrainians leaving their country before February 2022 were  denied refugee status and pushed towards labor migration, which makes  it difficult to categorize refugees as war-driven or labor-driven. Indeed,  Vang argues that a refugee is a compositional subject whose critical  position against the violence of colonialism and war, state government  and national belonging is configured through these very domains of  power (Vang et al., 2016). However, it is important to note that the link  between the wave of migration from Ukraine after 2014 and the war  was, in public opinion, quite clear; mass emigration to Poland simply did  not exist earlier. As in the cases of emigration waves from Syria and  North Africa, it is difficult to assert that we can determine the primary  motive driving mass migration."
"Among labor migrants in Europe, Ukrainians became a dominant  nationality. In 2013, 14 % of the 1.63 million first-time resident permits  issued in EU countries were issued to Ukrainians; in 2021, 30 %, or  856,000, permits went to Ukrainians. (The next most prominent group  was Moroccans, who claimed only 5 % of permits). Eurostat (2022) data  indicate that Ukrainians received the most residence permits of any  national group in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary,  Estonia, and Denmark (but not in Germany). Before the war in February  2022, Germany listed roughly 156,000 Ukrainians in the Central Reg ister of Foreigners (AZR); 48 % were women, 8000 said they were un employed, and another 20,000 registered as job-seekers."
"Both Poland (in 2018) and Germany (in 2020) liberalized employ ment and legalization procedures, extended temporary residence per mits, and signed bilateral social security agreements with Ukraine. Both  Poland and Germany sought to attract Ukrainian workers but fewer  Ukrainians worked in Germany than in Poland; Germany is farther away  and the Polish language is close to Ukrainian and was easier for labor  migrants to acquire. As a result, Poland became the primary EU desti nation for Ukrainian temporary workers, students, and permanent labor  migrants. The estimated number of Ukrainian migrants in Poland almost  tripled, reaching 507,000 in 2017 (Vakhitova & Fihel, 2020). According  to a survey conducted in 2018 among Ukrainian migrants in Poland,  over 70 % of those surveyed held different types of long-term permits,  and only 4.2 % claimed they were undocumented (Mikheieva & Susak,  2019). Before the war the Polish Central Statistical Office estimated that  there were 1.35 million Ukrainians working in the country (Duszczyk &  Kaczmarczyk, 2022). Most were from Western Ukraine (48 %) or the  center of the country (31 %, including 6 % from Kyiv). Only 16 % were  from southern Ukraine and 5 % from the east."
"Germany also lagged in welcoming Ukrainian labor migrants  because its legislative regime was less permissive than those of other  countries. Poland courted Ukrainian workers beginning in 2008 when it  allowed Ukrainians to work for up to 6 months per calendar year  without an employment permit as long as an employer sponsored the  worker. Germany relaxed barriers to accessing its labor market only in  2020 when the Skilled Immigration Act came into force (Khrebet, 2020)."
"Moreover, the Ukrainian workers going to Germany were different from  those heading to Poland; a 2012 survey found that 90 % of those who  had worked in the former had higher education, compared to 12 % of  those who had worked in Poland (Libanova, 2013)."
"The increasing number of Ukrainian labor migrants in the EU in  general combined with the liberalization of employment regulations,  created a new Ukrainian diaspora. This diaspora actively participated in  the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees in after 2014, and was even  more supportive after Russia's full scale aggression (Dvell & Lapshyna,  2022; Duszczyk & Kaczmarczyk, 2022). This Ukrainian diaspora,  together with local activists and volunteers, became the primary source  of support for Ukrainian refugees after February 24, 2022. Respondents  to our survey in Germany reported that upon arrival they were offered  help by different groups. Over 60 % reported receiving assistance from  Ukrainian and German volunteers or self-aid groups. 55 % reported also  having been helped by Germans they knew (friends, colleagues, or rel atives). Respondents in Poland were asked if they knew local people who  could help them (see Table 5)."
"Nonetheless, a survey by the National Bank of Poland between April  and May 2022 found that most Ukrainians arriving in Poland had not  been there before. About 14 % of the respondents had worked in Poland  before but 28 % said that family members had been employed in Poland  before and were thus able to orient them to the country. 12 % had  friends who had been there. The National Bank report concluded, an  important fact is that for more than 50% of the refugees who came to  Poland displaced by the war, it was a completely new experience, un known from both personal experiences and from the accounts of rela tives and friends. The degree to which respondents had friends or  family with knowledge of Poland varied depending on which part of  Ukraine the refugees had called home (National Bank of Poland, 2022)."
"Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, it was  primarily residents of Crimea and the Donbas that were displaced. After  February 2022, military hostilities forced people from central and  Table 5  Do you know people here that you can ask for help? If so, how many?

"Womens Studies International Forum 99 (2023) 102756 8 eastern Ukraine to flee (see Fig. 3). Whereas Ukrainians in the western  part of the country had considerable experience in moving back and  forth to European countries to work, those from central and eastern  regions had been less involved in cross-border labor migration and  movement, and had much less experience crossing the border into other  countries. For them, the need to leave suddenly came as a shock (see  Fig. 3)."
"The western part of Ukraine sent proportionately more female  workers than the south (46 % vs. 42 %) or the eastern part of the country  (41 %). This difference reflected the difference in the sectors to which  the regional populations gravitated. The West provided more workers  for domestic or public service jobs proportionally. In contrast, the South  and East of Ukraine sent migrants to work in industry, transport, con struction, and IT, which tend to be male-dominated (Mikheeva & Susak,  2019)."
"However receptive both Polish and German societies have been to wards displaced Ukrainians, we cannot overlook the darker side of  feminized migration. Young women traveling alone or with children are  a vulnerable group exposed to the risk of trafficking and exploitation."
"There have been reports pointing to cases of abuse (Bauer-Babef, 2022;  Pertek et al., 2022) but among our respondents, interlocutors testified  that they were suffering from war-related trauma (mostly psychological)  and had not had the bandwidth to pay attention to their security while  traveling or even settling with private hosts. None of our respondents  spoke of sexual abuse experienced while migrating, but they may have  been inhibited by a fear of disclosure or bias; some did mention that they  had been threatened with sexual abuse by Russian soldiers while still in  Ukraine. In Poland, respondents stressed that Temporary Protection  Status was not a solution to enforced dependency situations in which  they found themselves. Many complained about labor exploitation and  poor working conditions. Given that the Polish government recently  terminated the program that provided displaced Ukrainians with  financial support accommodations, this aspect of the situation calls for  additional research and monitoring."
"3. Conclusions  This paper has tried to describe the scale and nature of the Ukrainian  refugee migration since February 24, 2022. The toll of war on Ukraine,  on those still in Ukraine, and on those who have left the country has yet  to be fully understood. What is clear from our research is that those who  have arrived in Poland and Germany are both fortunate to have escaped  immediate danger, and are confronting tremendous personal, profes sional, financial and familial challenges. A 28-year old woman from  Kryvyi Rih explained during an interview in Poland:  I am very worried about what may happen not only to the city but  also to my parents. Now I am worried because me and my child are  safe, but my parents and friends are not. Almost all my friends, co-  workers, and everyone I communicated with stayed in Ukraine. I  have a guilty conscience that they are there, and I am here."
"For decades scholars have tried to adapt migration theory to  globalization-driven changes in how people move from one country to  another, and even back and forth (Castles, 2002) but circular migration  is difficult to capture in research. Even more unusual are situations like  what we observe in Poland and Germany, where circular or pendular  migration sets the stage for subsequent refugee movements and then  continues as some migrants forsake anchoring practices in their  receiving country to preserve the flexibility to return home at will."
"Our research suggests couple of important features of the wave of  Ukrainian refugees breaking across Europe since February 2022:  First, this new wave of migration is overwhelmingly female. The  literature on feminized forced migration is usually conceptualized as  the result of violence or [...] an act of opposition to violence at the  intersection of various regimes (Parson, 2010; Urba nska, 2016). This  definition focuses on the issue of feminized forced migration in the  realm of an individualized relationship to violence. It overlooks other  dimensions, including situational conditions or events that leave a mark  on the biographies of broader groups. As we consider the experience of  Ukrainian refugees, it is clear that we need to reframe the concept of  feminized forced migration to include migration driven by collective  events like war and other forms of group violence. Wartime-forced  migration is significantly different from migration described in the  context of individual or structural-legal conditions. In a sense, the self-  consciousness of forced migrants creates a mass situational context, it  triggers a social process that changes women. The dynamics of this  process are also influenced by the fluctuating nature of the stay in exile,  linked to departure and return."
"Second, refugees from Ukraine are traveling in groups with children,  which have an important impact on their concerns and decision-making."
"Before the war, labor migrants usually left their children behind and  traveled alone to another country for work. Now the women take their  children with them and leave their husbands behind. Almost all the  refugees interviewed in depth had one or more children with them."
"Many said that they only left Ukraine to keep their children safe. When  Russian aggression against Ukraine began in 2014, some families moved  only their children because they couldnt afford to move the entire  family (Mikheieva & Sereda, 2015). Now those who leave have been  taking the most vulnerable family members out of the country  chil dren, older people, or those who need medical care. People who  completed our surveys in Poland and Germany usually traveled in  groups of two and sometimes three generations, which affects what they  needed to arrange before they can enter the job market. One-third of  respondents focused on enrolling their children in school upon arrival."

"Third, Ukrainian migration patterns before Russia's full-scale inva sion of February 2022 have influenced choices and patterns of migration  after 2022. The mostly-male migrants from Ukraine before the war  created networks and experiences that were important to the mostly-  female migrants arriving in Poland and Germany after February 2022."
Our survey found that many Ukrainian war refugees arriving in Poland  knew not only someone from Ukraine who is already here (44 %) but  also Poles (43 %).
"There are, however, critical differences between what we see now  and Ukrainian migration to Europe before Russia's full scale invasion of  February 2022. Around three-quarters of Ukrainians in Europe are  women (United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2022),  and many are traveling with children and without husbands or elderly  parents. They face an acute need for childcare, school, and work, all  while trying to keep open the possibility of regularly traveling back to  Ukraine to check on relatives. This tension often determines whether or  not they apply for temporary protection or asylum status that could  lock them in place outside of Ukraine."
"Fourth, Ukrainian refugees have been driven from Ukraine by war,  but many want to regularly go back home from time to time. Because  men aged 1860 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, the women who have  left feel the need to return to check on them, or their houses, or elderly  relatives as soon as they have set up their children and traveling groups  in the destination country in Europe. The movement of Ukrainians back  and forth over the border is one of the unique features of this migration  crisis. After Russia pulled its troops back from north and northeast  Ukraine in May 2022, the frontline stabilized and migration into Ukraine  became almost as common as migration out of Ukraine. The pattern of  moving back and forth across the Ukrainian border tracks with labor  migration patterns before 2022, when Ukrainian labor migrants would  work in Europe for a few months and then return home before restarting  the cycle. Pendulum labor migration was particularly common among  female caregivers who worked during their 90-day visa-free stay in the  EU and then returned to their families for 90 days."
"Practically all our interlocutors declared they are willing to return to  Ukraine, but only under certain conditions. Many stressed that without  peace and renovated infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, and  apartments), it would be challenging to return, especially with children."
"These respondents are now planning longer stays in Poland or Germany  and were willing to overcome the challenges of emigration for their  children's safety and future. A 34-year old Ukrainian woman in Poland  explained,  We want these [Russian] orcs to be forced from our land and for us to  return home in peace and live our normal lives. But what we are  seeing now will be for a long time. There will be offensives, and  counterattacks. They will occupy the territory. I am afraid that  many more people, houses, schools, and hospitals will be affected   Already half of Kharkiv is simply destroyed. My grandmother was  left homeless because her house was on the outskirts of the city."

"The research described above reflects the first year of the war when  migrants left Ukraine en masse and tried to adapt to new circumstances  in Europe. How long the war lasts will determine whether refugees  decide to settle in Poland, Germany, or other receiving countries, if only  to avoid relocating their children again. Refugees who try to integrate  themselves into society in a new country will face additional challenges,  particularly since most of them have left family members at home   though this time, it is the husbands, not the children, who have  remained behind in Ukraine (Polish Economic Institute, 2022: 36). As  the war drags on, the needs of refugees will change, and require that  receiving societies adapt. A senior official at a Polish bank hosted five  Ukrainian refugees at his home in Poland and said, They need  employment, a stable income, free education, and free access to health  and public services to create a new life in Poland (Fusiek, 2022). Even  as they dream of returning home to Ukraine."

However, the detailed  influence degree, key weak points and influence process is still unclear in the current. Therefore, this study  established a newly improved under-load cascading failure model with consideration of overload limitation, and  used it to evaluate influence of Russian- Ukraine War on the global energy and food security. This study also  proposed a method to assess the network structure characteristic including robustness and resilience through  model simulation under different scenarios. The main results include: The upper limitation of node load has the  dominant function on the global energy and food security, while the influence of lower limitation parameter of  node load has limited function. All of the networks have relative consistent recover and anti-damage ability  against Russian and Ukraine War and the global panic except barley network. A key phenomenon we should  concern is that the largest trade flow amounts are not occurred in the failure nodes. The failure nodes are always  the countries with low economic scale and political status. The results tell us that we should further strengthen  the importance of enhance production ability and energy types to resist the risk of Russian and Ukraine War. The  global international organizations are also required to strengthen the function of balance the global security  demand of energy and food between big countries and small countries. We should pay more attention to the little  countries in the Africa and Asia to handle the risk."
"1. Introduction  The world is in a fragile state under the long-term pressure from the  COVID-19 pandemic in each field such as energy and food (Kruczkie wicz et al., 2021). The Russian invasion of Ukraine, occurred between  two main exporters of food and energy in the world would even worsen  the global energy and food security (Mbah and Wasum, 2022). The  Russia-Ukraine War (RUW) has actually induced roaring cereal and oil  prices, and global inflation (Deng et al., 2022). Tollefson (2022)  believed that although RUW has caused a short-term prices increase, it  would be a chance to prompt a long-term shift towards energy  sustainability."
"Many academics, government officials and journalists have discussed  the influence of RUW on energy and food security (Benton et al., 2022)."
"However, they are mainly discussed based on expert judgment, without  a suitable model analysis tool. The influence of RUW on energy and food  are mostly explored in the regional level such as European Union  (Blanchard and Pisani-Ferry., 2022), Morocc (Mengoub et al., 2022),  Indian (Meena, 2022), Azerbaijan (Mammadov, 2022), China (Oxford  Analytica, 2022a), Japan (Oxford Analytica, 2022b)."
"In the context of economic globalization, the supply and demand of  food and energy between each country are closed linked (DOdorico  et al., 2018; Ruhl., 2019 Gaupp, 2020). The regional element corruption  would cause global disaster in the complex network, which is called  cascading failures (Lee and Goh., 2016). The cascading failures process  has been revealed in the networks such as physical infrastructure net works (Guo et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021), economic and finance network  (Havlin and Kenett., 2015; Smolyak et al., 2018), and internet network  * Corresponding author."

"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 2 (Xing, 2020; Ren et al., 2018). Take the economic trade network as an  example, the cascading failures process can be described as below: Once  a country has a supply or demand problem of a product, then a global  cascading failure is triggered in the trade network due to the global  economic trade relationship. The cascading failures types including  edge-based-attack cascading failures and node-based-attack cascading  failures (Li et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014). The simple occurrence  mechanism is that under the initial attack, the load of the attacked node  or edge would be distributed to its neighbors, and once the load of  neighbors is larger compared with their load capacity, the neighbors are  destroyed, and finally caused network cascading failure (Zhao et al.,  2016). In some cases such as supply chain networks, the underload  cascading failures process would be considered, which indicates that  under the initial attack, due to lack of the load supply of the targeted  node or edge, the load of the neighbors is reduced and once lower with  the underload capacity, the neighbors are destroyed, and finally caused  network cascading failure (Yang et al., 2021)."
"However, the cascading failures method is still few used in the  research of global food or energy trade system, let alone the coupled  food-energy system. The current cascading failures analysis barely  consider the overload status and underload status at the same time. In  the single food trade system, the lack of a main food exporter country  would not cause food security risk of targeted importer countries, the  food security risk of targeted importer countries would induce second ary food risk of other countries. So as the single energy trade system."
"Whats more, due to the economic globalization, the basic primary  industry-food system, and the basic secondary industry-energy system  also have closed linkages, and have key influence on the whole eco nomic system of a certain country. One system breakdown would cause  the disruption of the other system. The cascading failures method is also  a suitable tool to assess the influence of war on the global energy and  food trade systems, which is still few can be found in the current  research."
"Academics have agreed that RUW would cause global food and en ergy crisis (Benton et al., 2022; Osendarp et al., 2022;  Zuk and  Zuk,  2022). However, there is still limited understanding of how RUW would  influence the global energy and food security and ways to design an  alternative means to mitigate the influence. To help address this gap, we  construct a global energy and food network that includes approximately  238 countries, three main types of energy and three main types of ce reals, so as the coupled energy and food networks. We create and  improve an underload cascading failure with consideration of overload  limitation to assess the influence of RUW on the global energy and food  security. To fill the existing gap between knowledge and practice on this  topic, a scenario analysis is also used to reveal the global energy and  food security risks due to RUW through comparing different capacity  and load change and coupling modes to answer some important ques tions: What would RUW bring to the global energy and food security?  What is the cascading failure process caused by RUW? Which are the key  and vulnerable countries that would be hurt by RUW? What are the best  means to mitigate the influence of RUW? Our findings offer significant  new insights that can reveal the impact degree of RUW and enable  policymakers to identify potential solutions to this global crisis."
"2. Materials and methods  2.1. Global Network Data  According to the UN Comtrade Database, complex trade networks of  energy and food covering all import and export flows occurring between  238 countries in 2020 have been developed. We downloaded data on  cereals and fossil fuels on May 1st, 2020. To avoid double counting  between exporter and importer, which named reporter and partner in  the UN Comtrade Database, the information on the importers is  extracted as import data are usually more accurate (Shi et al., 2021)."
"Furthermore, in the energy trade network, the more specific energy  types of coal, oil and gas are chosen to reveal their cascading failure  process. In the food trade network, only the cereals are considered,  especially barley, maize and wheat. The energy trade network and food  trade network are integrated according to the energy equivalent  (Tiewsoh et al., 2017)  2.2. Improved Cascading Failure Model  There are two basic cascading failure modes, one is overload  cascading failure, which is often used in infrastructure networks, and the  other one is under-load cascading failure, which is used in supply net works. A complex network usually considers one kind of cascading  failure mode at the same time. The initial load, the capacity, the dis tribution rule, and the failure rule are the four basic components of a  cascading failure model of a complex network (Wang et al., 2018). This  study establishes a newly improved under-load cascading failure model  with consideration of overload limitation (OLUCF). The main  improvement is that the model considers the under-load limitation and  overload limitation at the same time. However, different from the  existed cascading failure model, the overload limitation would not  induce nodes failure, the main function of overload limitation is that the  surplus load compared with the overload capacity would be canceled."
"Only the actual load is lower than the under-load limitation, then the  cascading failure process will be stimulated. The reason is that in the real  energy and food systems, each country has its upper-limitation of pro duction and consumption, once the actual load exceeds the  upper-limitation, they have trade amount self-adjustment ability when  the load is too high rather than destroy themselves. However, under the  background of economic globalization, once the actual load is lower  than the lower-limitation requirement, as the basic supply sector in the  economy system, the lack of the adequate energy and food will destroy  the country economy, and cause the cascading failure process."
"In the OLUCF, only the loads of nodes are considered in the initial  load and capacity determination firstly. Then, to simulate the influence  of RUW, the nodes of Russian and Ukraine will be disrupted. During the  load distribution process, both the loads of nodes and edges will be  considered. During the distribution process, the export amount from  Russian or Ukraine will be distributed to other edges from other exporter  countries which has trade relationship with the targeted importer  country according to their initial loads proportionally. Furthermore, the  upper-limitation of node load capacity will be assigned to each edge  according to their initial loads proportionally. Once an edges load ex ceeds its upper-limitation, the surplus amount will be distributed to  other edges from other countries which has trade relationship with the  targeted importer country. Then, subsequent overloads may occur."
"Finally, after all the surplus capacity of other available nodes are  distributed, the undistributable trade amount will be deleted directly."
"Then the failure rule may be triggered by the failed nodes, while the  export amount of export country or import amount of import country is  less than the minimum capacities, are forbidden from importing or  exporting food or energy. The dynamic progression of the OLUCF is  illustrated in Fig. 1."
"In the step1, we use the export amounts of countries to measure the  initial load. The capacity of each country has upper and lower limits."
"L0i = Exporti (1)   NCi(max) = L0i,  1 (2)   NCi(min) = { L0i, 0 <  < 1, Exporti > Importi Importi, 0 <  < 1, Exporti < Importi (3)  In which, NCi(max) indicates the upper limit of node i, NCi(min) in dicates the lower limit of node i, L0i indicates the initial load of node i,  Exporti indicates the export amount of food or energy of node i, Importi  indicates the import amount of food or energy of node i,  indicates the  fixed upper limit parameter,  indicates the fixed lower limit parameter."
X.-Y. Zhou et al.
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 3 In the step 2 and step 3, once Russian and Ukraine are disrupted, the  export amount from them will be distributed to other edges from other  exporter countries which has trade relationship with the targeted  importer country according to their initial loads proportionally."
"EWkt = EWkt0 + EWnt  EWkt0 b j=1EWjt0 (4)  In which, n indicates node Russian or Ukraine, t indicates countries  that import food or energy from Russian or Ukraine, k indicates coun tries that export food or energy to t except Russian or Ukraine, b in dicates the amount of nodes from node k to t, EWkt0indicates the initial  edge load from node k to t, EWnt indicates the initial edge load from node  n to t, b j=1EWkt0 indicates the summation of the initial edge load from  all nodes j to t, EWkt indicates the edge nodes from k to t after load  redistribution."
"In the step 4, the secondary load distribution happened, the upper-  limitation of node load capacity will be assigned to each edge accord ing to their initial loads proportionally."
"ECkt = NCk(max)  EWkt0 b j=1EWkt0 (5)   ECmt = NCm(max)  EWmt0 b j=1EWmt0 , m  = k (6)   EWkt = { EWkt, EWkt < ECkt ECkt, EWkt > ECkt (7)    EWmt =      EWmt +(EWkt ECkt) EWmt0 b j=1EWmt0 , EWkt > ECkt, EWmt < ECmt ECmt, EWkt > ECkt (8)  In which, ECkt indicates upper-limitation of edge load from k to t,  ECmt indicates upper-limitation of edge load from m to t, EWmt indicates  edge load from m to t."
"Finally, after all the surplus capacity of other available nodes are  distributed, the undistributable trade amount will be deleted directly."
"Then if the export amount of export country or import amount of import  country m in the energy or food network is lower than the lower limi tation of node m, the failure rule will be triggered by the failed nodes m,  which are forbidden from importing or exporting food or energy."
"To further reveal the possible coupling relationship between energy  and cereals network, and its influence on global energy and cereals  network. The coupling parameter between energy and food networks is  proposed, and simulated in OLUCF. It indicates that for the same  country, if its node load in the energy or food network is lower than the  limitation of the coupling value, then, the node in the other network  would be destroyed, no matter what the current node load is. It can be  recognized a new way to simulate cascading failure in the interdepen dent networks with consideration of the simple relationship of symbiotic  relationship, which is different from the previous method that focus on  the edges establishment and weight calculation."
"In addition, this study proposed a method to assess the network  structure characteristic including robustness and resilience, through  OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. The network robustness  strength means the ability to maintain its structure against RUW, which  is assessed through the following formula:  NRO = NEN=1 TN ,  = 1 (9)  In which, NEN=1 indicates the effective nodes number in the  network after cascading failure simulation which  is set as 1, TN in dicates the total nodes number in the network, NRO indicates the  network robustness strength."
The network resilience assessment including the resilience with only  consideration of the upper limitation increase of node load induced by  direct influence of RUW (NREd)and the resilience with consideration of  the upper limitation decrease of node load and node load increase  induced by the indirect influence from global panic of RUW (NREin).
"NREd indicates the recover ability of the network against RUW, and  NREind indicates the anti-damage ability against RUW and global panic."
NREd = NEN=a TN NRO (a > 1) (10)   NREind = NEN=b TN NRO (0 < b < 1) (11)  Fig. 1. Cascading failure process of the OLUCF   X.-Y. Zhou et al.
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 4 In which, NEN=a indicates the effective nodes number in the  network after cascading failure simulation which  is set as a, NEN=b  indicates the effective nodes number in the network after cascading  failure simulation which  is set as b. The higher value of NREd and  NREind indicates the better resilience against RUW and the global panic."
"The  value is obtained from the node load change ratio in the real  network. In this study, in order to exclude the impact of COVID-19, the  actual historical trade change trend from the most recent years of 2018-  2019 is adopted, we can find that most of the change ratio compared  with the current node load are in the range of 0.5-1.5, which is  accounted for 71.90% at least (table 1). Therefore, the value of  is set as  1.5 to calculate NREd and is set as 0.5 to calculate NREind. Researchers  can adopt their suitable  value according to their research requirement."
"2.3. Scenarios design  To observe the possible risk of RUW on the global food and energy  security, four types of cascading failure modes are simulated with  different node load and capacity change rules, and network coupling  rules (table 2). The scenarios are set according to the parameters chosen  and value assignment. Furthermore, in the energy trade network, the  more specific energy types of coal, oil and gas are chosen to reveal their  cascading failure process. In the food trade network, only the cereals are  considered, especially barley, maize and wheat."
"The node load indicates the total energy or food exports amount of a  country. The upper limitation of node load is assumed to be related with  the node load, it will increase 0 %-50% compared with current node load  in the upper limitation increase scenario and decrease 0 %-50%  compared with current node load in Load increase-Upper limitation  decrease scenario. Coupling parameter between food and energy  network. To identify the influence of coupling effect between energy and  food network on the global energy and food security, we assumed that  for the same country, if its node load in the energy or food network is  lower than the limitation of the coupling value, then, the node in the  other network would be destroyed, no matter what the current node  load is. Therefore, it should be a low value which indicates that the  coupling cascading failure process is not easy happened in the interde pendent network. Therefore, the change range of the coupling param eter is set between 0-0.4. Lower limitation of node load is a key  parameter that induced the cascading failure process in this process. It is  also the main improvement of OLUCF compared with the existed  cascading failure mode. Only the actual node load is lower than the  under-load limitation, then the cascading failure process will be stimu lated which is more in line with reality. Once the actual load is lower  than the lower-limitation requirement, as the basic supply sector in the  economy system, the lack of the adequate energy and food will destroy  the country economy, and cause the cascading failure process. The  change range of the lower limitation of node load is set between 0.1-0.6."
"To observe the critical threshold of the influence of each parameter on  the global energy and food network, the parameters value is set as a  series of number in a certain range. Then, the cascading failure results  with each parameters value combination can be obtained. The critical  threshold value can provide suggestions for risk identification and pre vention of global energy and food security."
"The first two scenarios are simulated in all of energy network  including coal, oil, gas, and the integrated energy network, and food  network including barley, maize, wheat and the integrated cereals  network. In the first scenario of upper limitation increase of node load,  we will observe the influence change of RUW on the global food and  energy security along with the countries production ability increase and  the ability to resist risk of import and export ratio decrease. The pro duction ability increase can be presented by the parameter value in crease of upper limitation of node load, and the ability to resist risk of  import and export ratio decrease can be indicated by the parameter  value increase of the lower limitation of node load. The second scenario  of load increase and upper limitation decrease is established based on  the assumption that to prevent the hurt of global panic induced by the  RUW on the local food and energy security, the import country would  increase their import demand, and the export country would decrease  their exporter demand. The difference compared with the first scenario  is that the parameter of node load increases  The last two scenarios are only simulated in the integrated energy  and cereals network, which assumed that the node failure in the inte grated energy or cereals network would induce the node failure in the  other network, which can be recognized as cascading failure in inter dependent networks (Duan et al., 2019). In this study the cascading  failure process in interdependent networks happened through the  coupling parameters of food and energy networks. The third scenario is  based on the first scenario with consideration of the coupling process  between food and energy networks. The fourth scenario is based on the  second scenario with consideration of the coupling process between  food and energy networks. The coupling effect is presented by the value  of coupling parameter between food and energy network. The higher of  the value, the easier happen of the coupling cascading failure process in  the interdependent networks."
"3. Results and Discussion  3.1. Global energy and cereals contribution of Russian and Ukraine  It can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 12.09% to the  global energy trade, while Russian accounted for 12.01%. Fig. 2 shown  that the countries with highest imports percentage from Russian were  mostly located in the Europe and Asia. It also indicates that they may  more easily been influenced by RUW. Focusing on specific energy types,  it can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 15.60% to the  global coal trade, 11.34% to the global oil trade and 10.00% to the  global gas trade, while Russian accounted most of the export amount."
"In the global cereals trade network, the pattern is quite different from  the energy network. It can be found that Russian and Ukraine contrib utes 18.83 % to the global cereals trade, while Russian and Ukraine  nearly accounted for the same ratio. Fig. 2 shown that the countries with  highest imports percentage from Russian and Ukraine were mostly  located in the Africa, Europe and Asia. It also indicates that they may  more easily been influenced by RUW. Focusing on specific cereals types,  it can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 19.55% to the  global barley trade, 14.44% to the global maize trade and 10.00% to the  global wheat trade, while Russian accounted most of the export amount."
"While for barley, the nearly accounted for the same ratio, for maize,  Ukraine accounted most of the contribution, and for wheat, Russian  accounted for the 66.66% among the contribution of them."
"From the view of exports countries of cereals and energy from  Russian and Ukraine, it can be found that they are mostly of the coun tries with relative lower economy scale. The export amounts of energy  only accounted for 6.30% of the total imports amount of the United  States, and 12.68 in China, which are mainly come from Russian. While  for cereals, they only accounted for 0.17% in the United States and 23.11  % in China, which are mainly come from Ukraine."
3.2. Influence of RUW on global energy security  Influence of RUW on global energy trade network can be found  through OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. While LLNL is  Table 1  Frequency distribution of  value in the energy and food network   Range  Energy  Food  Coal  Gas  Oil  Barley  Maize  Wheat  <0.5  6.25%  8.65%  9.39%  14.77%  8.96%  10.46%  <1.5&>0.5  78.13%  75.00%  80.11%  73.86%  72.39%  71.90%  >1.5  15.63%  16.35%  10.50%  11.36%  18.66%  17.65%   X.-Y. Zhou et al.
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 5 determined, it can be found that along with the increase of upper- lim itation of node load, the number of retained countries become more."
"Once the upper-limitation increase to 120% of the current node load, all  of the four types of energy network would maintain 80% of the coun tries. The integrated energy network and oil trade network have the  strongest robustness against RUW, they can maintain more than 80% of  the countries, even though other countries have no extra production  ability. while coal trade network is more easily influenced by RUW, once  other countries have no extra coal production ability, only 42.92% of the  countries are left in the network. Furthermore, the existed countries  number of integrated energy network, oil trade network and gas  network would recover to 94.12%, 93.67% and 80.70% while ULNL  increase to 105%, and it requires ULNL increase to 115% to maintain the  existed countries number of coal network at a high level. Therefore,  RUW have more influence on coal and gas trade network than oil  network. Through the separate simulation of node failure of Russian and  Ukraine, it can be found that it is Russian that mainly influence the  global energy trade network. Through observation of the influence  change along with LLNL increase while ULNL is equal to 0.3, it can be  found that due to the adequate upper limitation of node load, the LLNL  change has little influence on global energy network. There is still more  than 92.52% existed in the network under attacks. Among them, the gas  and coal trade networks are more easily influenced by LLNL change, it  indicates that the average exports amount percentages of gas and coal  contributes from Russian are higher than oil and the integrated energy."
"Under the LIULDS, it can be found that RUW would produce much  larger influence than their actual energy export amount due to ampli fication effect of energy demand and storage from fears of energy  shortages. The integrated energy trade network and oil trade network  presented their strong robustness against RUW that they can still  maintain more than 40. 75% of the countries while the node load in crease to 50 %, the upper limitation of node load decrease to 50 %, and  LLNL is equal to 0.4. The coal and gas network can only maintain 9.13 %  and 3.95 % of the countries in the final. While ULNL is equal to 0.3, it  can be found that the coal and gas trade network would be nearly  destroyed dramatically, the effective countries of the integrated energy  and oil trade network would be also reduced significantly, which only  57.14 % and 61.18 % of the countries are maintained."
"Through comparison of Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c,3d, it can be concluded  that the vulnerability of the gas trade network is the highest, once the  network upper limitation is reduced and the node load increase, it will  be easily influenced by RUW. However, it also has relative strong  resilience, once the upper limitation of node load increase 5%, then the  effective nodes ratio will increase from 55.70 % to 80.70 %. The  parameter of upper limitation of node load has the dominant function on  the global energy security, while the influence of lower limitation  parameter of node load has limited function. Under ULIS, which is the  optimistic and simple scenario, if all of the energy exporter countries  own more than 15% surplus production ability, all of the four types of  energy network can maintain at least 87.72% of the country nodes."
"However, under LIULDS, which can be recognized as the extreme situ ation caused by the global energy security, the global energy trade  network can be hurt obviously, especially the coal and gas trade  network. During RUW, the energy exports change of Russian plays the  key role on the global energy trade network compared with Ukraine,  which is consistent the results of the 3.1 section."
"3.3. Influence of RUW on global cereals security  The Influence of RUW on global cereals trade network can be  assessed through OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. While  LLNL is set 0.4, the increase of upper-limitation of node load would  recover the effective country nodes of the cereals network. Among the  four types of cereals network, the integrated cereals network can recover  most quickly following by maize trade network, while there are 20%  surplus capacity of other countries, they can reserve 97. 47 % and  92.00% of the total country nodes separately. The wheat trade network  is influenced most significantly by RUW. Until there are 35% surplus  capacity of other countries, it can reserve 91.73% effective country  nodes. Specially, the influence of RUW on the barley trade network is  limited, and have little recovery along with the increase of upper limi tation of node load, it indicates that in the barley trade network, the  export destination countries from Russian and Ukraine is limited, so as  the import sources diversity of the countries which import barley from  Russian and Ukraine. Therefore, RUS can only destroy restricted country  numbers, and these countries are not easy obtain barley from other  countries. Russian has greater influence on wheat trade network, while  Ukraine has greater influence on maize trade network. Through obser vation of the influence change along with LLNL increase while ULNL is  equal to 0.3, it can be found that RUW has more obvious influence on the  cereals network, especially the wheat trade network compared with the  energy trade network. The cereals trade network requires more upper  limitation of node loads in order to protect the network integrity  compared with the energy trade network. What is more, RUW would  induce the wheat supply of 20 % of the total countries less than 40 %."
"Fig. 4c presents some different results compared with the energy  network. In the energy network, gas network is most significantly  influenced by RUW under ULIS and LIULDS. In the cereals network, the  wheat network shows its vulnerability and the barley network shows its  robustness facing RUW under ULIS. However, under LIULDS, along with  the upper limitation of node load decrease and node load increase, the  barley network present opposite characteristic. The reason is that, the  barley trade network is little relied on Russian and Ukraine and is  strongly relied on other countries. The global scare of food shortage  induced by RUW would change the upper limitation of food export  amount, although RUW could not directly influence the global barley  trade network. The indirect influence of RUS would significantly hurt  the export amount from other countries, and finally lead to the collapse  of barley network.

"3.4. Influence of RUW on global coupled energy and cereals security  In the current coupling effect research of energy and food systems,  they are mainly carried out from the area of waterenergyfood nexus  research based on the methods of integrated index, computable general  equilibrium model, ecological network analysis, life-cycle analysis,  input-output analysis, system dynamics model, agent-based modeling,  etc (Endo et al., 2020). They can reveal overall status of coupled energy  and food systems, and the linkage strength between energy and food  systems. The coupling effect are revealed based on the indicators cor relation and flow amount. However, the cascading failure mode have  Fig. 2.

"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 7 not been used in the coupled effect research of energy and food systems."
"OLUCF can reveal the robustness, resilience, and the ability to resist risk  of the energy and food network, and can also identify the influence of a  certain disaster on the energy and food network through simulated  strike. The results can provide direct support for global energy and food  security management. The coupling parameter is firstly proposed to  observe the influence of coupling effect of energy and food systems on  the global energy and food security. We assumed the possible coupling  strength between energy and food networks, then, we observed that  under the specific coupling parameter value, what would happen to the  coupled energy and food networks, and the influence on the global en ergy and food security. The results can tell us what is the influence  Fig. 3. Influence of RUW on global energy trade network under ULIS and LIULDS   X.-Y. Zhou et al."
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 8 extent that the coupling effect would bring to the global food and energy  systems, the possible risky nodes and risk transfer path, and the critical  risky threshold."
"To further reveal the possible coupling relationship between energy  and cereals network, and its influence on global energy and cereals  network. The coupling parameter between energy and cereals networks  is proposed, and simulated in OLUCF. It can be found that under ULIS,  while ULNL and LLNL is set as 0.3 and as 0.4 separately, the global  energy and cereals networks has adequate potential to face the crisis of  RUW, and the coupling parameter has nearly no influence on them."
Fig. 4. Influence of RUW on global cereals trade network under ULIS and LIULDS   X.-Y. Zhou et al.
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 9 Under LIULDS, the integrated energy and cereals network would have  relative more reduction of the effective country nodes with consider ation of the coupling process compared with the scenarios without  consideration of the coupling process. The effective country nodes in the  integrated energy network would reduce from 69.75 % to 56. 30% while  the coupling parameter value is set as 0.40, and the effective country  nodes in the integrated cereals network would reduce from 54.43 % to  51. 05% while the coupling parameter value is set as 0.40. The result  indicates that although RUW has more significant influence on the ce reals network than energy network, the coupling parameter would  enhance more influence RUW on energy network than cereals network."
"The more important point is that, under LIULDS, along with the stronger  coupling strength between the energy and food network, the easier to be  destroyed by the specific disaster. The critical threshold is 0.05, it in dicates that for the same country, if its node load in the energy or food  network is lower than 0.05, then, the node in the other network would  not be easily destroyed."
"3.5. Network Robustness and Resilience  This study proposed a method to assess the network robustness and  resilience characteristic against RUW under ULIS and LIULDS. Through  observation of the bubble size of network in Fig. 5, it can be found that in  the energy network, the integrated energy and oil network have the  strong robustness against RUW, and in the food network, the cereals and  barley network have the strong robustness against RUW. Through  observation of NREd and NREind value, it can be found that the coal,  cereals and wheat networks have the strong ability of recover and anti-  damage against RUW and global panic, while gas and maize network  have relative strong recover ability and low anti-damage ability. Totally,  all of the networks have relative consistent recover and anti-damage  ability against RUW and the global panic except barley network. The  barley network has low recover ability and anti-damage ability."
"It can be also found that the there is no positive correlation between  robustness and resilience. The strong robustness of barley network does  not bring its strong resilience against RUW. It indicates that in the barley  network, Russian and Ukraine have limited contribution to the global  exports, and other main countries own the large ratio of global exports."
"The low robustness of coal network does not mean its low resilience  ability. It indicates that Russian and Ukraine have dominant role in the  global coal exports, however, the role can be easily replacement by other  coal exports countries. For the network of the integrated energy and oil  network, they have strong robustness, it indicates Russian and Ukraine  have normal contribution to the global exports, at the same time, there  are other countries with similar oil export scale that although they can  not completely share the oil exports amount of Russian and Ukraine,  they have the ability of anti-damage by RUW and the global panic. Fig. 6  3.6. Typical influence process of RUW  The typical influence process of RUW on the global energy and ce reals network are assessed while the upper limitation of node load is set  as 0.3 and the lower limitation of node load is set as 0.4 under ULIS and  LIULDS. Under ULIS, theres no failure node in both of the energy and  cereals network except Russian and Ukraine. The trade flow amounts  have been changed a little, the total trade flow amount is reduced by  1.05%, in the energy network, while in the cereals network, the total  trade flow amount is reduced by 0.71%. However, the influenced  countries nodes in the energy network are more concentrated, while it is  more disperse in the cereals network. The trade relationship edges have  been reduced from 10260 to 9832 in the energy network, while in the  cereals network, it has been reduced from 8528 to 8113. Through  observation of the trade flow pattern, it can be found that there is some  difference between energy network and cereals network. Without  consideration the political relationship, it can be found that RUW would  cause the significant reduction of energy trade flow from Russian to  China, so as the flow to Korea Republic, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and  Japan, while these influenced countries would search for replacement,  such as the flow increment from Indonesia, Australia and Saudi Arabia  to China, Norway to Germany, Canada to United States, Nigeria to  Turkey, etc. RUW would cause the obvious cereals trade reduction from  Russian and Ukraine to Egypt, Russian to Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and  Ukraine to Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia, Turkey and Korea Republic."
"Then, these influenced countries would search for replacement such as  France, Romania, United States and Australia to Egypt, United States  and Canada to China, etc."
"Considering the information of international relations order and  geographical relationship, some more specific results we can obtain. The  energy imports status of China may still maintain a normal level. The  energy imports of Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Japan and Korea Re public would be vastly reduced. Especially, the long-term low-carbon  energy transformation has decreased their dependency on the coal en ergy. At the same time, the clean energy ratio can not be increased in a  short period, the limited land area in these countries has also restricted  the potential of photovoltaic energy (Dupont et al., 2020). Therefore,  there are three suggestions: Firstly, they should not only enhance the  imports amount from the existed energy exports countries, the other  newly energy trade relationship should be also established with other  energy exports countries. Although, it would indicate higher trans portation cost. For the countries themselves, they should further develop  suitable new energy resources such as nuclear energy, wind energy, etc."
"They may even re-enable coal-based thermal power plant to deal with  the urgent energy security crisis, even though it would induce  short-term carbon emission increment. Secondly, the obvious suggestion  is that other energy exports countries should enhance the ability of en ergy exports to deal with the global energy crisis. Lastly, the RUW does  not indicate the absolute reduction of energy exports from Russian and  Ukraine. The countries which have good relationship with Russian can  Fig. 5. Influence of RUW on coupled energy and cereals networks under ULIS and LIULDS   X.-Y. Zhou et al."
"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 10 support as transfer station for energy trade, such as China."
"For the food security, the food imports of Egypt, Turkey, Saudi  Arabia, Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia, and Korea Republic would be  vastly reduced. Similarly, they should not only enhance the imports  amount from the existed food exports countries, the other newly food  trade relationship should be also established with other food exports  countries. Although, it would indicate higher transportation cost. The  other food exports countries should enhance the ability of food exports  to deal with the global crisis."
"Under the LIULDS with consideration the global panic, it can be  found that, large ratio of countries nodes is destroyed or hurt, including  72 countries nodes in the energy network and 108 countries nodes in the  cereals network. Most of the failure nodes are the little countries without  adequate concentration in the current media such as Afghanistan,  Pakistan, Algeria, Libya, Oman, Tunisia in the Africa and Central Asian."
"There are also 1644 edges in the energy network and 3211 edges in the  cereals network are destroyed. The energy trade flow edges with large  reduction include edges from Canada to United States, from Russian,  Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia to China, from Australia to Japan, etc. The  edges with large increment include edges from Canada to Japan, Nigeria  to United States, Canada and Nigeria to China, and United States to  Turkey. In the cereals network, the trade flow amount of the main edges  including from Russian to Egypt and Turkey, United States to Mexico  and Japan, Ukraine and Canada to China are reduced. The partial results  are consistent with the influence judgement of RUW on the Egypt and  Turkey from Lang et al (2022) Fig. 7."
"A key phenomenon we should concern is that the largest trade flow  amounts are not occurred in the failure nodes. The reason is that always  the countries with large economic scale have more energy and food  requirement, at the same time, they have more diversity of energy and  cereals types and supply sources, and are more able to resist the risk of  war. However, the failure nodes are always the countries with low  economic scale and political status, they are unable to handle the risky  caused by war, under the global panic, they do not have much more  approaches to search for supply replacement of energy and cereals, and  are more easily trapped in the crisis of energy and food shortages."
"4. Conclusions  This study established an improved under-load cascading failure  model, and can support for assessment of risky and influence process in  the energy cereals network due to Russian and Ukraine War."
"4.1. Policy implication  Based on the model simulation, we firstly can find that the impor tance of Russian and Ukraine on the global energy and cereals network."
"In the energy networks, the gas and coal trade networks are more  significantly influenced by RUW than the oil network. In the cereals  networks, RUW has more influence on wheat trade network. Totally, the  cereals networks are more easily influenced by RUW than the energy  networks."
"Through scenario simulation, it can be found that the parameter of  upper limitation of node load has the dominant function on the global  energy and food security, while the influence of lower limitation  parameter of node load has limited function. It reminds us that we  should keep reserved capacity of energy and cereals as more as possible  to resist the risk such as war, global warm and epidemic. We can also  find that the integrated energy and cereals network has more robustness  and resilience compared with the single type of network. The results tell  us the energy substitution is an effective way to handle the risk of RUW."
"The more diversity of energy types was developed, the more able to  survival in the risky world."
The lower limitation parameter of node load has limited influence on  Fig. 6. Network Robustness and Resilience under ULIS and LIULDS. Note: the bubble size indicates the robustness strength of each network. The higher value of  NREd and NREind indicates the better resilience against RUW and the global panic. The black lines with arrow indicate the average value of NREd and NREind of the  eight networks.

"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 11 the global energy and cereals network with only consideration of the  direct influence of RUW. However, if the global panic of energy and food  shortages caused by RUW are assessed in the simulation, it would induce  the global disasters. Even the integrated energy and cereals trade  network can only maintain nearly 40. 75% and 54.43 of the effective  countries nodes. The results further strengthen the importance of  enhance production ability and energy types to realize to resist the risk  of RUW. The critical threshold of upper limitation and lower limitation  of node load to protect global energy and food security is also obtained,  totally we should try to maintain the export capability of the main  exporting countries higher than 20 % to resist risky of RUW. With  consideration of the global panic, we should try to maintain the export  capability no less than 5%. The possible coupling relationship between  energy and cereals network has limited influence on the global energy  and cereals network with only consideration of the direct influence of  RUW. Under LIULDS, the influence of the coupling effect on the energy  and cereals network are amplified. Whats more, the result indicates that  although RUW has more significant influence on the cereals network  than energy network, the coupling parameter would enhance more in fluence RUW on energy network than cereals network."
"Through network characteristic comparison of robustness and resil ience, it can be found that the coal, cereals and wheat networks have the  strong ability of recover and anti-damage against RUW and global panic,  while gas and maize network have relative strong recover ability and  low anti-damage ability. Totally, all of the networks have relative  consistent recover and anti-damage ability against RUW and the global  panic except barley network. The barley network has low recover ability  and anti-damage ability. There is no positive correlation between  robustness and resilience. The strong robustness of barley network does  not bring its strong resilience against RUW. It indicates that in the barley  network, Russian and Ukraine have limited contribution to the global  exports, and other main countries own the large ratio of global exports."
"The low robustness of coal network does not mean its low resilience  ability. It indicates that Russian and Ukraine have dominant role in the  global coal exports, however, the role can be easily replacement by other  coal exports countries."
"The detailed influence process of RUW on the global energy and  cereal network can be also revealed through the OLUCF established in  this study. The results tell us that RUW would induce global energy and  food security crisis for all of the countries, the big countries with large  economic scale would face relative obvious reduction crisis of energy  and food supply, and the little and poor countries with small economic  scale would be more easily collapsed. Therefore, the existed interna tional energy and food security organizations should try to balance the  global security demand between big countries and small countries to  avoid the big countries to import and store too much energy and food  that the other small countries are unable to maintain their energy and  food security. Some new global powerful organizations can also be  established to perform this function. We should pay more attention to  the little and poor countries with small economic scale and low political  status, which are the failure nodes in our mode simulation under  LIULDS, especially the countries in the Africa and Asia to handle the risk."
We should provide more energy and food supply for them.
"4.2. Model applicability and limitation  The model established in this study can tell us the influence of RUW  on the global energy and cereals networks quantificationally. The net works robustness and resilience against RUW can be also revealed based  on the method of this study. The key weak points in the complex  network and influence process can be also obtained under the specific  circumstance. The model can also support for other events influence  assessment, especially for the evaluation of material flow network such  as energy, food, information, metals and other important materials."

"Resources, Conservation & Recycling 188 (2023) 106657 12 Theres still some deficiencies require improvement in the future  research. First of all, in this study, the international relationships are not  considered in the current research, the energy and food flow are  determined based on the existed flow load, however, the political ten dency would greatly change their decision. The influence factors of  geography, politic and international relations order should be quantified  and concerned in the future research (Theocharis and Jungherr., 2021)."
"The related knowledge of computational communication studies and  political communication sciences can be further introduced to observe  the influence of theses factors on the energy and food networks. Then  the robustness and resilience of the evolved network can be obtained  based on the OLUCF. Secondly, in the influence assessment of RUW, we  assumed that Russian and Ukraine are completely destroyed as the  initial failure nodes, although the current results can provide us guid ance to identify the global energy and cereals network weakness and  risky. It possibly wont happen in fact, so it requires us to further assess  the influence of RUW on exports ability of Russian and Ukraine. Only the  direct relationship between imports and exports countries are consid ered in the current research. The intermediate nodes can be further  considered that import energy and food from the initial destroyed  countries and exports to other nodes. Lastly, to achieve more available  results, the more scenarios can be set and simulated based on the key  parameter combination of upper-limitation node, lower-limitation node,  coupling effect with or without consideration the global panic of RUW."

"The impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war on global financial markets  Marwan Izzeldin a, Yaz Glnur Murado glu b, Vasileios Pappas c,*, Athina Petropoulou d,  Sheeja Sivaprasad e  a Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YW, UK  b Queen Mary University of London, E1 4NS UK  c University of Kent, Kent ME4 4TE, UK  d SOAS University of London, WC1H 0XG, UK  e University of Westminster, London NW1 5LS, UK    A R T I C L E  I N F O    JEL classification:  G15  C24  Keywords:  Ukraine war  Financial markets  HAR  Markov switching  Commodities  A B S T R A C T    On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the Ukraine. In this paper, we analyze the response of European and global  stock markets alongside a representative sample of commodities. We compare the war response against the  recent Covid-19 pandemic and the not-too-distant 2008 global financial crisis. Applying a Markov-switching  HAR model on volatility proxies, estimates are made of synchronization, duration and intensity measures for  each event. In broad terms, stock markets and commodities respond most rapidly to the Russian invasion; and  post-invasion crisis intensity is noticeably smaller compared to both the Covid-19 and the GFC. Wheat and nickel  are the most affected commodities due to the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"1. Introduction  On February 24, 2022 Russia invaded the Ukraine. Moscow's MOEX  index dropped almost 9% in the week following the invasion (Financial  Times, 2022d). Stock market indices also registered significant losses, as  Fig. 1 shows. Far-reaching effects in Europe, and possibly the world, are  only beginning to unfold. Supply chain disruptions amplify the upsurge  in commodity prices, while a massive refugee influx unfolds with almost  7 million Ukrainians escaping their country.1  The economic sanctions imposed in the US, Europe and elsewhere  suggest that Russia's economy will contract significantly (Pestova,  Mamonov, & Ongena, 2022). Rising energy revenues are unlikely to  counteract the economic repercussions of the global pull out from  Russia. This may prove the greatest hit to the global economy since the  Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008; and it may exceed the impact of  Covid-19 given the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"Countries in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa import  75% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine (World Bank, 2022b)."
"Ukraine's exports of seed oil account for 40% of global exports. Over  13% of corn exports and 5% of wheat exports come from Ukraine. Russia  accounts for 25% of global natural gas exports, 18% of coal exports, 11%  of crude oil exports, 18% of wheat exports and 14% of fertilizers (World  Bank, 2022b). With countries still in a recovery phase from Covid-19,  the after-effects of the Russian invasion are likely to have a com pounding effect financially. In the aftermath of Covid, forecasts indi cated GDP growth of 3.9%; this has been revised to 3.6% (Financial  Times, 2022b). Inflation was expected to rise by 7.5% in 2022 (European  Commission, 2021). However, the impact on inflation will depend on  monetary policy response and is yet to be realised."
"Following the invasion, several studies examined the impact of  sanctions (Berner, Cecchetti, & Schoenholtz, 2022) on global financial  markets (Deng, Leippold, Wagner, & Wang, 2022; Huang & Lu, 2022);  We would like to thank the editor (Brian Lucey) and an anonymous reviewer for their insightful suggestions.

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 2 on macroeconomic risks within the Euro area (Ferrara, Mogliani, &  Sahuc, 2022); and on the international monetary system (Brunnermeier  et al., 2022). However, sanctions are variable across countries, business  sectors and corporations.2 Thus in this paper, we strategically steer away  from the sanctions-based literature and examine the impact of the  Russian-Ukrainian war on financial market volatility. We obtain and  analyse estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity of stock  markets and representative commodities for various segments (i.e., en ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We also draw  comparisons with the impact of the 2008 GFC and the Covid-19  pandemic. These three events constitute the main shocks to the global  economy over the past fifteen years. For our research design we employ  a Markov-switching HAR model on daily volatility proxies around each  crisis. This allows for endogenously identified regime shifts upon which  basis we compute metrics for the synchronization, duration, and in tensity of each crisis."
"The paper contributes to the fast-emerging literature on the impact of  the Russian-Ukrainian war upon economic and financial outcomes. Our  results show an instantaneous reaction of world stock markets to the  Russian-Ukrainian war. This suggests that the invasion was interpreted  as real news by investors. The timeliness of the response is unlike that  of either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where a lag of up to seven days  is evidenced. The crisis duration metrics, however, suggest that the  severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has been muted compared to  either the GFC or the Covid-19. We attribute this to an expectation that  the war would not be prolonged. Moreover, it is possible that investors  mis-interpret this event. Past war-like experiences have been markedly  different; they have primarily involved one-off terrorist attacks, have  been beyond the European continent, and were not met by widespread  sanctions. Thereby investors may have been falsely drawing insights  from such prior experiences. Commodity insights concur with the stock  markets in all but one aspect: intensity. Despite average intensity values  being comparable to both the GFC and the Covid-19, specific com modities (e.g., wheat, nickel, lead) reveal strong ongoing pressure in this  asset class following the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis. Given the stra tegic importance to the economy of the affected commodities implica tions on inflation and supply chain are yet to unfold."
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the  relevant literature. Section 3 presents a synopsis of the data and the  methodology. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings.
Robustness analysis is presented in section 5. A final section concludes.
"2. Background information  2.1. Volatility and global financial markets  Volatility is important for analysing risk in financial markets; how ever, it is not directly observable. The increased availability of intraday  data has shifted attention to realised measures for volatility modelling."
"Realised volatility (RV) has been shown to dominate several parametric  approximations, including GARCH-type and stochastic volatility (SV)  models (Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, & Labys, 2003). Volatility is  highly persistent, and the flexible and easy-to-estimate heterogeneous  autoregressive (HAR) (Corsi, 2009) has emerged as a modelling work horse (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev, Li, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2020;  Bollerslev, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2018). That volatility is affected by  Fig. 1. Major stock market indices response following the Russian-Ukrainian invasion."

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 3 economic shocks is well-known. To capture structural breaks a variety of  transition models may be embedded within the HAR framework.3 For  example, Izzeldin, Murado glu, Pappas, and Sivaprasad (2021) utilize a  smooth-transition HAR (ST-HAR) to identify intensity, timeliness, and  homogeneity of the Covid-19 crisis upon G7 stock markets. Parametric  models of volatility estimation can also allow for similar dynamics, see  for example Pappas, Ingham, Izzeldin, and Steele (2016) who use a  Markov-switching multivariate DCC-GARCH model to examine the  synchronicity of the GFC crisis upon European stock markets. Yip,  Brooks, Do, and Nguyen (2020) examine the volatility spill-over effects  between oil and agricultural products using a Markov-switching setup."
"2.2. Global financial markets and geopolitical events  In Fig. 2 we compare the volatility reaction of financial markets to  major geopolitical and key historical events over the last century. Using  the S&P 500 index due to its long data availability, we calculate two  volatility proxies, namely the realised volatility as the sum of squared  returns over the past 22 trading days, and the conditional volatility  estimated from a GARCH(1,1) model. In addition, we plot Economic  Policy Uncertainty (EPU), which is a news-based indicator, and the  historical Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRH), which gauges adverse  geopolitical events and related risks obtained from a variety of news-  based outlets.4  Financial markets respond to a wide array of geopolitical events. The  sample under consideration contains wars, invasions, terrorist attacks  and periods of tension. A cursory inspection finds the response of global  financial markets to the Russian-Ukrainian war to be relatively muted  compared to other financial crises (e.g., the 2008 Lehman collapse, the  1987 Black Monday, and the Covid-19). However, it is more pronounced  than that of several terrorist attacks (but not the 9/11) and other in stances of war or invasions."
"Though wars generally have a strong impact on financial markets,  the relevant literature is limited. Not surprisingly, Wisniewski (2016)  finds that wars result in widespread destruction of human and physical  capital and stock markets fall. Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2011)  investigate 447 international political crises  but not all are wars. They  find that the global stock market returns would have been higher by  3.6% per annum but for these events. Hudson and Urquhart (2015)  study the effect of the second world war (WWII, thereafter) on the  British stock market and find that only one of the wartime events clas sified as important resulted in a structural break. Frey and Kucher  (2000) examine the prices of the government bonds of five European  countries during WWII. They find that the loss and gain of national  sovereignty affected the bond prices of the countries. Frey and Kucher  (2001) analyse government bond prices of Germany and Austria traded  on the Swiss bourse during WWII. They show that war episodes are  clearly reflected in government bond prices. Brown Jr and Burdekin  (2002) study German bonds traded on the London stock exchange  Great Crash Great Depression Poland invasion France invasion Pearl Harbor Iron Curtain SKorea invastion Suez crisis Cuban crisis JFK assassination Gulf of Tonkin Six-day war Penn Central bankruptcy Munich Olympics Yom Kippur War Nixon resigns Reagan shooting Cont'l bailout Black Monday Kuwait invasion Soros FWTC bombing Asian crisis Yemen bombing 9/11 Iraq war Madrid bomb London bomb Bear Stearn Lehman collapse Boston bomb Crimea Paris bomb Brexit Syria war Covid-19 Ukraine invasion 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1928 1934 1941 1948 1954 1961 1968 1974 1981 1988 1994 2001 2008 2014 2021 Volatility H R P G , U P E EPU GPRH Realised Volatility Conditional Volatility Fig. 2.

"Notes: We use the S&P 500 returns to calculate: i) realised volatility, as the sum of squared returns over the past 22 trading days; ii) conditional volatility, based on a  GARCH(1,1) model. The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is a news-based indicator of economic uncertainty and is available from 1985 onwards. GPRH is the  historical geopolitical risk index."
"3 A variety of transition models have been used that typically can be classified  according to the nature dynamics they introduce (i.e., discrete, or smooth), the  break identification (i.e., exogenous or endogenous) and the number of breaks  and regimes allowed. We direct you to Hamilton (1989) and Tsay (2005) for an  in-depth discussion."
"4 Due to data limitations EPU data are available from 1985 onwards, see  Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for details. Caldara and Iacoviello (2022)  construct the geopolitical risk index, which is available here. We use the his torical version for its extended coverage. The index is available here:  https://www.matteoiacoviello.com/gpr.htm  M. Izzeldin et al."
International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 4 during WWII and document a negative impact on only two events during  the entire conflict course. Waldenstr om and Frey (2008) observe sudden  shifts in sovereign debt yields and spreads in the Nordic bond markets  during WWII. Frey and Waldenstr om (2004) compare sovereign debt  prices on the Zurich and Stockholm stock exchanges and conclude that  market efficiency has not been affected by WWII.
"Some studies examine the impact of US military engagements upon  financial markets. Leigh, Wolfers, and Zitzewitz (2003) analyse financial  market data to assess the economic consequences of the war with Iraq."
"They find that net oil importers are most likely to experience adverse  effects from the war. Also in respect of Iraq, Rigobon and Sack (2005)  find that war risk is associated with declines in Treasury bond yields and  equity prices. Amihud and Wohl (2004) find that the Iraqi war is asso ciated with rising stock prices. Perhaps an increasing probability that  Saddam Hussein would be deposed was interpreted as good news by  stock market investors. Choudhry (2010) apply a structural break test to  investigate the structural shifts in returns and volatility and determine  whether such shifts are associated with the events of WWII. Omar,  Wisniewski, and Nolte (2017) analyse the impact of 64 instances of se vere international crisis and classify 43 events as the war sample."
Their event window starts 50 trading days before the outbreak of war  and ends 50 trading days thereafter. They find that returns were  3.47% for the World stock market index and 4.67% for S&P 500.
"Wisniewski (2009) examine the impact of WWII, the Korean war and  other US military engagements and provide evidence of how these  events are negatively related to the market value of stocks. Based on the  discussion above, we conclude that the impact of wars on stock markets  and other asset classes is detrimental."
"2.3. Covid-19 and global financial markets  The novel corona virus (COVID-19) was first detected in China in  December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a  pandemic in the following mid-March. The response across financial  markets was dire. In a month, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 fell by  35% and the volatility of the financial markets was comparable to the  2008 GFC (Baker et al., 2020). To curtail the spread rate, governments  introduced widespread lockdown measures that impeded global eco nomic activity. Business sectors and countries were affected; relatedly  Izzeldin et al. (2021) find adverse effects on all sectors but for the  Technology firms, which weathered the pandemic better. Sergi, Harjoto,  Rossi, and Lee (2021) show that economic outcomes, as tracked by the  Barro Misery Index (BMI), are driven by the Covid-19 related cases and  deaths, and are reflected on stock market return volatility. Benkraiem,  Garfatta, Lakhal, and Zorgati (2022) conclude that financial contagion is  more intense in America than in Asia."
"3. Data and methodology  3.1. Data  We examine global financial market reactions in three crises events,  namely the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and  the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. For each event, we use the [3,3]  months estimation window using daily data.5 Our choice of the bench mark date (t = 0) on each occasion is: i) the Lehman Brothers collapse on  15/9/2008; ii) the announcement of Italy's lockdown on 9/3/2020; iii)  the invasion day on 24/2/2022, respectively.6  Volatility data for the stock markets comprise the realised variance  for a selection of global stock markets obtained from the OxfordMan  institute realised library.7 Realised variance (RV) is calculated as the sum  of squared intraday returns (Andersen et al., 2003; Andersen, Bollerslev,  Table 1  Descriptive statistics  stock markets."

Range is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values. GFC refers to the 2008 global financial crisis; WAR to the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian war.
Realised measures are not available for Italy and Portugal during the GFC period.
"5 Our window length choice is consistent with Omar et al. (2017). As  robustness we also use a larger window [6,6] months for the 2008 GFC and  the Covid-19 crisis and the results remain qualitatively similar. Thus, we retain  our [3,3] specification for consistency purposes across the three events."

We compute the realised volatility and express it in percentage  annualized format for the rest of the analysis."
"Volatility data for the commodities are not available via the realised  library. Hence, we resort to conditional parametric volatility estimators  of the GARCH family. Specifically, consider a T  1 vector of demeaned  asset returns rt, the conditional variance is estimated as a GARCH(1,1)  process:  rtF t1 N ( 0, h2 t ) (2)   h2 t =  + au2 t1 + br2 t1 (3)  Subsequently we compute the conditional volatility and express it in  percentage annualized format for the rest of the analysis."
"Table 1 presents key descriptive statistics for the realised volatility  across the sampled countries for the three crisis periods under exami nation. Brazil, Norway and Denmark emerge as the countries with the  highest average realised volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-  Ukrainian war crises respectively. By contrast, Singapore exhibits the  lowest average realised volatility during the GFC and war periods, and  the second lowest during the Covid-19."
Table 2 presents key descriptive statistics for the conditional vola tility of commodities over the three periods of crisis under examination.
"Lead, oil and natural gas are the commodities with the highest average  conditional volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war  periods respectively. By contrast, gold exhibits the lowest average con ditional volatility during the GFC and Russian-Ukrainian war periods."
Soyabean shows the lowest conditional volatility during the Covid-19.
"3.2. Methodology  Modelling realised measures has relied extensively on the hetero geneous autoregressive model (HAR) (Corsi, 2009). The superior per formance of the HAR in modelling and forecasting realised volatility is  well-established (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev et al., 2020; Bollerslev,  Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2016). Compared to ARFIMA, estimation and  forecasting are more easily obtained from HAR models. Following Corsi  (2009) the HAR model is defined as:  ht = c + (d)ht1 + (w)h(w) t + (m)h(m) t + et (4)   where et~iid(0,2) with ht (w) and ht (m) defined as follows:  h(w) t = 1 5 (ht1 + ht2 + ht3 + ht4 + ht5) (5)   h(m) t = 1 22 (ht1 + ht2 +  + ht21 + ht22) (6)  To allow for non-linear dynamics in the volatility process we allow  for a Markov-switching structure. Markov-switching models have been  used in conjunction with the GARCH family of models for similar pur poses in Pappas et al. (2016). By contrast, Izzeldin et al. (2021) use a  smooth transition variant of the HAR to accommodate crisis periods."
"Contrary to smooth-transition models, Markov-switching allows for a  discrete shift in the regime, which is more appropriate for our setup  where we compare financial market volatility during the three crises.8  Markov-switching models utilize a latent state variable (st = m) to  denote the state m of the economy in period t, with m = 1, , M. By  construction, a Markov-switching model estimates the transition prob ability from the data. To allow for more realistic dynamics during each  of the turmoil periods, we assume that the HAR parameters related to  the weekly and monthly volatility are regime invariant. The following  Markov-switching HAR model is estimated using maximum likelihood  and robust standard error:  ht = cst + (d) st ht1 + (w)h(w) t + (m)h(m) t + et (7)   where the regime probabilities are given as:  Pr ( st = mi|st1 = mj ) i, j = 0, 1 (8)  For each of the three financial crises under consideration, we  compute synchronization, duration and intensity measures following  Pappas et al. (2016). To assess the synchronization of each financial  crisis, we compare the estimated crisis transition date for each index (Ti)  Table 2  Descriptive statistics - commodities."

The threshold  line is centred at each crisis date, with the graph showing the pre- and  post-three-month evolution window. A cursory inspection finds the  response during the Covid-19 to be more pronounced than the GFC and  the Russian-Ukrainian war events."
"Table 3 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea sures for each of the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war crises. In  each table, we report the median for each country and the median values  for key country groupings namely the G7 economies, the European  countries, and the rest of the world (RoW). Next, we discuss these results  by measure focusing on Europe. Crisis synchronization median values  suggest an instantaneous reaction of stock markets to the invasion news."
"This is observed for the Europe group, but also for the G7 and the RoW  groups. The timeliness of the response is unlike those pertaining to the  GFC or Covid-19 events. In the GFC crisis, synchronization show Europe  to respond with a 4-day lag, and the G7 taking the longest at seven days."
"During the Covid-19, Europe responds at a 1-day lag; yet G7 and RoW  take longer."
"Coming now to discuss percentage duration, we find Europe values at  7.25%, suggesting that stock markets spent a significantly shorter period  in the crisis regime compared to the GFC, and the Covid-19. A similar  result is observed for the RoW countries. We discuss intensity values  next. Our results show that crisis intensity for Europe following the  Russian-Ukrainian war stands at 89.89%, significantly higher than  either the GFC (at 73.76%) or the Covid-19 (at 82.16%). The G7 and  RoW values during the Russian-Ukrainian war are 69.08% and 71.31%  respectively. Interestingly, these values are lower for the G7 group  compared to both the GFC and the Covid-19 (77.67% and 86.70%  respectively), however they are comparable across all crises for the RoW  group."
In summary our analysis of the stock markets here suggests that their  volatility response to the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis has been instan taneous. This is unlike the GFC or Covid-19 where a certain lag was  observed. We believe that the instantaneous reaction of stock markets  shows that the invasion was interpreted as real news by investors.
"Despite the prolonged summoning of Russian forces at the Ukrainian  borders, an actual invasion had not been discounted by the markets and  was considered unlikely, until it materialized. The crisis intensity,  however, suggests that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has  been, on a global scale, muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid-  19. We find this puzzling given the severity of such an incident. It is  plausible that investors mis-interpret this event. Past warlike experi ences have been markedly different in the sense that they involve mainly  one-off terrorist attacks and/or have been away from the European  continent. Thereby investors may be falsely drawing insights from such  prior experiences and underestimating the real implications of the  Russian-Ukrainian war (Financial Times, 2022e; The Guardian, 2022b)."
"However, as Russia's aggression in Ukraine remains unabated, the world  seems to embrace that the transition into a long-term conflict appears a  likely scenario (BBC, 2022; Financial Times, 2022a). Besides, the pro longed conflict has even led banks to downgrade their growth forecasts  (JP Morgan, 2022)."

A  cursory inspection of the graphs shows that commodities are affected in  a comparable way across the three crisis events. Furthermore, the nature  of each crisis appears to be particularly relevant for specific commod ities. Base materials such as copper and nickel are more affected  following the GFC, whereas oil is more affected following the Covid-19  crisis.

"Table 4 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea sures for all commodities in our sample. In addition, we report median  values for all commodities and for each commodity segment (i.e., en ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We discuss  synchronization, duration and intensity measures in turn, starting by the  overall commodity measures and then focusing on the specific com modity segments. Crisis synchronization median values suggest that  commodities respond with a 2-day lag after the invasion materialized;  this is earlier than either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises. The early  response of commodities is largely driven by the precious metals and  base materials that have reacted faster. Agricultural commodities  responded with a 2-day lag, which is comparable to the GFC crisis re sults. By contrast, the agricultural commodities reacted latest in the  Covid-19 crisis, with a 17-day lag."
"We now proceed to discuss percentage duration values. During the  Russian-Ukrainian war, the median duration has been at 6.42%,  significantly lower than either the GFC (at 6.81%) or Covid-19 (at  7.38%) crises. High duration values are evidenced for precious and base  metals. Agricultural commodities show approximately two times higher  median duration value during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to  the Covid-19."

"International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 10 Commodity intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been at  23.65%, which is similar to the other two crises. However, this aggre gate result masks the heterogeneity across commodity segments. Spe cifically, crisis intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been the  highest for the base materials (at 38.26%) and lowest for the precious  metals (at 18.36%). Within the agricultural commodities, with an in tensity value of 48.87%, wheat is the most severely affected. The high  crisis intensity value for wheat may be partially explained by the un certainty over Ukraine and Russia, both within the largest exporters  worldwide, being able to meet world demand (FAO, 2022). Nickel has  been the most severely affected commodity with an intensity value at  116.65%. This is largely explained by the sanctions over Russia, a top-3  nickel exporter, in conjunction with rising demand that is associated  with its use in electric vehicles (Daniel, 2022)."

Still, the  particularly high duration and intensity values for specific commodities  reflect the strong ongoing pressure on commodities and have been  highlighted as a cause for concern. In particular, a stressed commodity  market could have several ramifications, such as triggering food crises to  putting pressure on the derivative trading platforms (Financial Times,  2022e)."
"5. Robustness  In the main analysis the transition between volatility regimes has  been discrete and modelled via a Markov-switching HAR model. We  perform a robustness check using a smooth transition specification,  which allows for an analogue-like transition between regimes.10 Com mon in both specifications is the endogenous identification of the  transition between the regimes. In the smooth transition HAR (ST-HAR)  model the transition between two regimes is governed by the expo nential function, see Izzeldin et al. (2021) for more details. Of the HAR  parameters, we assume the constant and the daily component to be  regime dependent, while weekly and monthly volatility components are  regime invariant. The following equation is estimated via nonlinear least  square techniques and Newey-West robust standard errors:  ht = 0 + (d)ht1 + (w)h(w) t + (m)h(m) t + ( 0 + (d)ht1 )  ( 1 exp (  / 2 st(st )2 ) ) + et (13)   where st is a threshold variable with unknown threshold () and slope  () values; 0, 0 and (d), (d) are the threshold coefficients for the  constant and the daily component respectively; t is the stochastic error  term. The threshold coefficient () gauges the synchronicity of the  transition, with high (low) values indicating a lag (lead) in the transi tion. The slope coefficient may be interpreted as the transition speed  between regimes, with high (low) values giving evidence towards an  abrupt (gradual) shift."
"Table 5 presents the median estimated slope and threshold param eters of the ST-HAR model for the stock markets (Panel A) and com modities (Panel B). Based on their estimated values we compare the  transition patterns across regimes for each crisis.11  As compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19 crisis, the lower  threshold coefficient value during the Russian-Ukrainian war indicates  the earlier response of the global stock markets (see Panel A) and  commodities (see Panel B) to the event. Thus, it corroborates the main  findings of the paper."
"The slope coefficient is the highest for the G7 stock markets during  the Russian-Ukrainian war (7.78) suggesting an abrupt regime change,  more pronounced than either the Covid-19 (6.14) or the GFC (2.23). The  fact that European stock markets respond in a smoother fashion to the  Russian-Ukrainian war compared to the Covid-19 (1.55 vs 9.26) sub stantiates further our main finding that investors may be falsely  assessing the severity and the duration of the event."
"Similar to global stock markets, commodities record the largest slope  coefficient during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to either of the  GFC or Covid-19 crisis. The abrupt transition is mainly driven by agri cultural commodities (e.g., wheat) and base materials (e.g., nickel), a  result that is consistent with the main analysis. Interestingly, precious  materials show a more muted response compared to past crises."

International Review of Financial Analysis 87 (2023) 102598 12 markets. We analyse the volatility response of European and global stock  markets and a representative sample of commodities to the war crisis  and compare it against the recent Covid-19 pandemic and the 2008  global financial crisis.
"This study employs a Markov-switching HAR model on volatility  proxies and obtains estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity  for each crisis event. The Markov-switching HAR model allows for an  endogenously identified regime shift."
"Our results show an instantaneous reaction of global stock markets to  the Russian-Ukrainian war, which suggests that the invasion was  interpreted by investors as real news. This is markedly different to the  GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where there was a lagged response. The  crisis duration metrics suggest that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian  war has been muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19. We  attribute this to the market expectations that the war would not be  prolonged. The findings for commodity markets concur with that of  stock markets except for one aspect: intensity. Commodities generally  appear to have weathered the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis in a similar  way to the Covid-19 and GFC crises. However, crisis intensity values for  specific commodities reveal strong ongoing pressure in this asset class,  and to the economy given the strategic importance of some of these  commodities."
"In the short-term the Russian-Ukrainian war is expected lead to lower  economic growth and rising inflation. Annual GDP growth in 2023 is  projected to slow to 2.25% worldwide, to 0.5% in the US and to 0.25% in  the Euro area; well below pre-war forecasts (OECD, 2022). Following  the gradual global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,  inflationary pressure had already been building up. However, the  Russian-Ukrainian war, with its impact on energy and food prices, has  accelerated the inflationary pressure worldwide.12 On the energy front,  the heavy reliance of the EU on Russia leaves the former vulnerable to  gas supply reductions through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline (Eurostat,  2022; Financial Times, 2022c; World Bank, 2022c). Besides, the within-  EU heterogeneity on gas reliance leaves the union vulnerable to political  tension, for example over the proposed 15% voluntary reduction in gas  usage (The Guardian, 2022a)."
"The long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine will depend on  current policy responses and priorities. Most recently, policy makers  have been promoting energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of en ergy production, which is in line with the green goals of a transition  away from fossil fuels to arrest climate change. However, such goals may  become more elusive if policy makers rank energy security and  affordability higher in their agenda. On the food market front, produc tion shortfalls, trade disruptions and increased input costs raise com modity prices, most notably wheat. Ukrainian wheat exports, that  account for nearly 10% of global exports, ceased after the closure of  Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Exporting wheat overland is more expensive  than by sea (World Bank, 2022a). Rising food prices and disruptions to  trade pose risks to the coherence of the society. Besides, food security  ranks high on the policy makers' agendas; thus necessitating interna tional cooperation on these issues. With regard to metal markets, our  results show that nickel has been heavily affected. Russia accounts for  20% of high-grade nickel used in batteries. Sanctions have disrupted  supply from Russia's mining giant Nornickel. The production of  stainless steel, which accounts for 70% of nickel consumption is slowing,  mainly in China (World Bank, 2022a). Developments in these com modities may affect the affordability of clean forms of transportation,  and ultimately jeopardise the transition to a low-carbon economy."
"The macroeconomic impact via commodity markets and rising in flationary pressure may plunge global economies into recession. Stake holders are concerned about commodity-driven contagion effects that  could have significant implications on financial markets and the real  economy (Financial Times, 2022e). It remains to be seen what remedial  steps will be taken to tackle a global recession. Future studies can further  examine the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war and its far-reaching  effects on global economies as the war unfolds."

How will sanctions and countersanctions on energy trade affect the EU-Russia and the worlds energy trade pattern? This paper sets six energy trade scenarios based on the degree of energy sanctions and counter- sanction measures imposed by the EU and Russia. We use the global multi-region comparative static CGE model to simulate the changes in macroeconomic indicators in major countries worldwide. The diversion effect of energy trade and the impact on the national economy caused by geographical risks quantitatively analyzes. The results show: (1) Energy sanctions will cause economic damage to both sides, in the worst-case scenario, the EU economic loss reaches 1.488%, the Russian loss reaches 4.8%, and worldwide inflation will rise; (2) Russias counter-sanctions will have a direct economic impact on the EU, but will not improve its economic situation; (3) Energy sanctions will bring about a direct energy trade transfer effect, the EUs energy imports will be diverted to non-Russian markets, and Russian energy exports will also shift to Asian markets, and energy trade between the two economies will be significantly reduced; (4) Energy supply will have a profound impact on the worlds economy and society, leading to social instability and a decline in total output of 2.895%. Energy games will have a negative impact on the worlds carbon emission reduction and energy consumption structure transformation. Through quantitative analysis of the impact of energy sanctions on the world economy and society, the energy game caused by the geopolitical crisis will harm both parties involved in the game and the world economy. The world pattern will return from the development pattern of cooperative division of labor to a situation of conflict and confrontation, which is not conducive to the transformation of energy trade and consumption structure under market rules."

"1. Introduction Energy trade has been dominated by geopolitics, and energy sanctions are an extension of the political game."
"The Russia Ukraine conflict has led to several rounds of sanctions in the Western world, mainly the United States and the European Union, including individual, economic, and financial sanctions (Chepeliev et al., 2022; Mahlstein et al., 2022). The sanctions are aimed at weakening Russias economy, making it unable to pay for its high military spending, and forcing Russia out of Ukraine."
The most important of the measures should be sanctions on Russias energy trade. The consequences of the energy sanctions imposed by Western countries against Russia significantly impact the economy and society of the EU and Russia more than other stakeholders. This is mainly because the EU is highly dependent Corresponding author.

"on Russian energy imports, and Russias primary energy export market is also in Europe. Economic entities urgently want to know what impact the energy game caused by geopolitical con- flicts will have on the world economy and social stability and what kind of impact it will have on the world energy trade pattern."
"Geopolitical risks (GPRs) will directly affect energy trade, lead- ing to energy security (Liu et al., 2021). The industrial production of human society is highly dependent on fossil energy consump- tion. Still, the geological distribution of fossil energy determines that the worlds energy consumers and suppliers are in a state of separation. Therefore, geopolitical turmoil in energy-exporting regions directly affects the energy security of the worlds energy- consuming countries (Inshakov et al., 2019; Vasylkivskyi et al., 2020). Many scholars have conducted detailed research on energy security issues arising from geopolitical conflicts (Ang et al., 2015; Bompard et al., 2017; Kruyt et al., 2009). These studies focus on several aspects. One is the impact of geopolitical conflicts on https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2023.01.124 2352-4847/ 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Energy Reports 9 (2023) 30823095 energy trade (Inshakov et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). The second is the impact of geopolitical conflicts on energy prices (Gong et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022). The third is the counter- effect of energy consumption structure transformation on geopol- itics (Dutta and Dutta, 2022; Salameh, 2014; Su et al., 2021). The research on the impact of geopolitical conflicts on energy trade is mainly carried out from two aspects. First, suppose the regional geopolitical risk of the energy-consuming country occurs. In that case, it will lead to a decline in its energy demand, triggering a reduction in the countrys dependence on global energy trade."
"Geopolitical conflicts in such energy-consuming countries have a relatively limited impact on international energy trade (Lee et al., 2017). On the other side is the geopolitical conflict between en- ergy exporters. Political instability in energy-exporting countries can directly impact global energy supply through supply chains such as energy output and transportation (Yang et al., 2014). In GPRs research, a more critical research direction is the impact of GPRs on energy prices and will combine oil price fluctuations with the energy security of energy-importing countries. However, there are still differences in academic research on the mechanism of GPRs on oil prices. Cunado et al. (2019) show that only a higher GPR drives up oil prices through dynamic research on GPR versus actual oil returns between 1974 and 2017. Noguera-Santaella (2016) found through an analysis of essential oil price fluctuations and interventions in different geopolitical events that geopolit- ical events had different impacts on oil prices in 2000. With the conclusion of carbon emission reduction agreements around the world, the worlds major energy-consuming countries have begun to change their energy consumption structure, gradually increasing the proportion of renewable energy and reducing fossil energy consumption (Vakulchuk et al., 2020). The transformation of the energy structure has had a considerable impact on the worlds geopolitical conflicts. Since 2010, many scholars have noted that renewable energy consumption may bring new geopo- litical conflicts. Scholars research views on this issue are also divided. On the one hand, they believe that the energy transition is unlikely to reduce energy-related conflicts (Escribano, 2018; Freeman, 2018; Hurd et al., 2012; Jacobson et al., 2017; Raman, 2013). The other side believes that energy-related conflicts will decrease as the energy transition deepens and the proportion of energy self-sufficiency in countries gradually increases (Pierri et al., 2017; Scholten and Bosman, 2016; Smith Stegen, 2018), the increased use of renewable energy reduces the influence of oil and gas exporters in global politics (Su et al., 2021)."
"The impact of geopolitical conflicts on capital markets and social welfare is also an important theoretical and empirical research direction. Energy price fluctuations have a heteroge- neous effect on importing and exporting countries. For energy- consuming countries, rising energy prices mean higher produc- tion and transportation costs while affecting capital market liq- uidity through inflation and interest rates, reducing social welfare levels (Antonakakis et al., 2017). On the other hand, energy suppliers have seen rising incomes, leading to higher domestic consumption, investment, and productivity, more liquidity in capital markets, and higher overall social welfare (Apergis et al., 2015). At the same time, GPRs have a significant impact on market sentiment, investment, and decision-making behavior in energy markets, and these effects are ultimately reflected in energy price fluctuations (Humphreys, 2005; Ji et al., 2019a,b)."
"Previous research on geopolitical conflict and energy security has focused on using empirical analysis methods to analyze the relationship between GPRs and energy security indices or energy price indices. The impact of energy sanctions on world energy trade has rarely been studied from the perspective of geopolitical conflicts by the GTAP model. The tensest RussiaUkraine conflict has triggered a political game around the world. Unlike the past world energy security problems caused by GPRs, this contest between the EU and Russia in the energy field will likely reshape the world energy trade pattern. So, in the energy game caused by geopolitical conflicts, what is the EUs and Russias macroeco- nomic impact? What is the diversion effect of conflict on world energy trade? What impact will it have on transforming the worlds energy structure? These are all issues of great concern to decision-makers worldwide and need to be solved urgently. This study uses the GTAP model to evaluate the impact of different levels of energy sanctions on energy trade and macroeconomics on both sides of sanctions. The study finds that: (1) Energy sanctions will bring macroeconomic losses to both sides of the game, and Russias economic losses are more serious, but the EU will bear a higher level of inflation, and the world will be plagued by high inflation; (2) Russias energy counter-sanctions can produce specific effects, but at the cost of deteriorating its economic situation; (3) energy sanctions will lead to a decrease in direct energy trade between the two countries, but an increase in indirect energy trade; (4) The energy game between the two sides will directly drag down the development of the world economy, lead to a decline in total world output, and adversely affect carbon emission reduction and energy consumption structure transformation."
"The marginal contribution of this paper is: First, under the framework of the global trade model, it quantitatively reveals the global impact of the energy game between the EU and Russia caused by geopolitical conflicts, measures the impact effect of energy sanctions on both sides, and from the results of the escala- tion of the energy game, the two sides can only lose in this game; Second, in the global integration pattern, the competition be- tween energy consuming countries and energy supplier countries will be weakened through the transfer effect of energy trade, and diversified energy demand and supply will become the central theme of world energy trade in the future; Third, it provides new evidence for studying the mechanism of geopolitical conflicts on energy prices. The remainder of this paper is structured in the following manner. The second part provides an overview of the state of energy trade between the EU and Russia. The third part introduces the methods and data used in this paper. The fourth part analyzes the empirical results of the article. Part V draws conclusions based on the results of the analysis."

The purpose of the EU is to promote the balanced economic and social development of member States through establishing a space without internal boundaries, the coordinated development of the economy and society, and establishing an economic and monetary union leading to a unified currency."
"Since its inception, the European Union has been at the center of the world economy and politics. The total GDP of the EU in 2021 ranks third in the world after the United States and China, ranking third in the world economy, and the entire trade volume of the EU has also reached 13,082.447 billion dollars. As can be seen from Table 1, the EUs large-scale economic activities require massive energy consumption, and the total primary energy consumption of the EU in 2020 reached 55.74 exajoules, accounting for 10.01% of the worlds total immediate energy consumption. However, the EUs own fossil energy reserves are insufficient, with oil reserves accounting for only 0.1% of the worlds oil reserves, natural gas reserves accounting for 0.2% of the worlds total, and coal re- serves accounting for 7.3% of the worlds resources. The enormous 3083 "

Russias total energy consumption is relatively low com- pared to the EUs. The GDP of the Russian Federation is only 11th in the world GDP ranking in 2021, and it has a population of about 143 million. Although the level of economic activity is not high, Russia has abundant energy and mineral resources, of which, as of 2020, proven oil reserves account for 6.2% of the worlds reserves, natural gas reserves account for 19.9% of the worlds resources, and coal reserves account for 15.1% of the worlds reserves, so it also determines Russias economic structure based on energy exports."
"2.2. EU energy structure analysis Since the implementation of the first climate change plan in 2000, the total primary energy consumption of the EU has been on a downward trend since 2006. Due to the impact of the pandemic, EU energy consumption fell sharply in 2020 until it rebounded sharply in 2021. According to Fig. 1, the perspec- tive of the EUs energy consumption structure, the proportion of crude oil consumption has been declining from 41.35% in 2000 to 35.46% in 2021, the proportion of renewable energy and natural gas consumption is rising, the proportion of renewable energy consumption has increased sharply from 0.9% to 13.17%, and natural gas consumption has increased from 19.94% to 23.75%."
"Although the EUs energy reform policy has achieved the goal of reducing the total primary energy consumption, there is still a gap between the energy structure transformation goal of reducing the proportion of fossil energy consumption and increasing the ratio of renewable energy consumption to 20%. The analysis of EU fossil energy reserve indicators shows that the EUs economic development needs energy imports from external markets."
"From the perspective of the structure of the EU energy import trade, Russia is the leading importer of EU energy. In 2020, the EU relied on imports for 58% of its energy consumption, and its self-sufficiency rate was only 42%. While the EU has been trying to wean itself off Russian energy imports, Russia is the EUs leading supplier of gas, oil, and coal. In 2021, the EUs oil, refined oil, and coal imports from Russia accounted for 29.64%, 38.44%, and 48.08% of its various energy imports. As the primary fossil energy supporting the EUs green energy transformation, natural gas imports mainly include pipeline imports and liquefied imports, of which pipeline natural gas transportation accounts for 68.26% of the total natural gas imports. In 2021, natural gas from Russia accounted for 71.74% of EU pipeline transport imports, and liquefied natural gas imports accounted for 20% in Russia. The main reason the EU depends on Russian energy is related to Rus- sias abundant energy reserves, low prices, and low transportation costs, especially the construction of gas transportation pipelines, such as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2."
"Combined with the current situation of the EU energy trade, the EUs short-term implementation of severe energy sanctions against Russia will cause a more serious energy shortage in the EU."
"2.3. Energy trade in Russia Russia occupies a critical position in the worlds energy supply chain as a country with relatively rich energy reserves. According to data published by the Russian Federal Customs Service, global oil demand shrank sharply in 2020 due to the epidemics impact."
"Russia and Saudi Arabia have implemented production cuts, and oil and gas exports have hit new lows  resulting in a 36.6% reduction in exports of energy goods. Even with a sharp decrease in energy demand, the share of energy goods exports in Russias export trade fell from 62.1% in 2019 to 49.6% in 2020, which is still the highest. In other words, Russias foreign trade structure is still dominated by the export of energy commodities. By the end of 2020, crude oil accounted for the most significant proportion of Russias trade value of different energy types, accounting for 47.51% of the total energy trade, followed by the export of crude oil products, accounting for 30.62% of the total. As shown in Fig. 2, Russian crude oil export destinations are concentrated in Europe and Asia, of which oil exports to Europe account for 53.05% of the total value of oil exports, and Asia accounts for 45.22%."
"Among the Asian destinations for Russian crude exports, China is its largest buyer, importing 32% of Russias crude. In continental Europe, the Netherlands imports 12.4% of Russian crude oil, and Germany imports 8.57% of Russian crude oil. The export trade structure of Russian crude oil products is more dependent on the European market. The value of crude oil products exported by Russia to European countries accounted for 60.37% of the total export value, while Asia accounted for 26.59%. The refined oil imports of the Netherlands, France, and Germany accounted for 14.1%, 6.08%, and 4.62% of Russias exports, respectively. Russias petroleum gas export trade is more dependent on the European market, which consumes 71.92% of Russias petroleum gas, and the rest is almost entirely exported to the Asian market. Coal exports are of relatively small value and more dispersed than the top three energy commodity destinations. An analysis of Russias energy trade structure shows that Europe and Asia are the main markets for its energy trade. The European market is currently more important than the Asian market. This energy trade struc- ture will shift significantly with the EUs energy sanctions against Russia."

"2.4. Analysis of the EUs dependence on Russian energy Through the analysis of EU energy consumption and the struc- ture of Russian energy export trade, it can be seen that the EU is highly dependent on energy commodities provided by Russian energy, and Russias foreign energy trade is also dependent on the European market. Through the analysis of the EUs energy consumption and the structure of Russias energy export trade, the EU is highly dependent on energy commodities provided by Russian energy. In contrast, Russias foreign energy trade also depends on the European market. There are three main reasons for the EUs dependence on Russian energy. First, the geographical advantage between Russia and the EU makes it the most conve- nient for the EU to obtain energy from Russia with the lowest transportation cost. Second, the EUs aggressive energy transition policy has led to the withdrawal of traditional energy sources from the market too quickly, resulting in large fluctuations in the internal energy supply. Third, the development speed of renewable energy is not as fast as expected, and the stability is poor. Through the analysis of the EUs energy reserve data, it can be seen that the EUs energy reserves are not enough to support economic development needs. The geographical location between Russia and the EU is more advantageous than other energy suppliers in the world, and the two major economies have reduced the cost of energy transportation through the construc- tion of oil and gas transportation pipelines, which has formed the physical basis of the EUs dependence on Russian energy. With the increasing importance of ecological and environmental issues in the EU, it has proposed a radical energy consumption struc- ture transformation plan. In this plan, increasing the proportion of renewable energy and reducing traditional fossil energy are essential indicators. The implementation of the policy has led to the large-scale closure of coal-fired thermal power plants in Euro member countries, turning to natural gas and renewable energy. In the energy transformation process, natural gas, as a cleaner energy source compared to other fossil energy sources, has been used in large quantities to meet the set emission reduc- tion targets. Russia has exported a large amount of natural gas to the EU through Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines to complete the transformation of the EUs energy consumption structure."
"Whether or not the EU undergoes an energy transition, it will be challenging to eliminate its dependence on cheap Russian energy."
"Therefore, the EUs energy ban on Russia will directly affect its energy security. In the short and medium term, it will be difficult for the EU to find a suitable energy supply organization to replace Russia. The diversion effect of energy trade will lead to a rapid increase in energy prices, affecting the welfare and social and political stability of EU member states."
"In summary, as an essential demand side and supply side in the world energy pattern, the impact and changes in energy trade between the two countries will have a spillover effect on the global energy trade pattern, which will affect the stability of the worldwide energy trade network structure. The energy game be- tween the two economies is bound to disrupt the existing energy trade network and threaten global energy security. Therefore, it is necessary to quantitatively analyze the energy game between the EU and Russia to understand the effects of world energy trade and the macroeconomic impact caused by the conflict between the two countries."
"3. Method and data 3.1. Method To simulate the impact of energy sanctions and countersanc- tions between the EU and Russia on the two major economies and the world economy under geopolitical conflicts, this paper conducts an empirical analysis based on the global multi-region comparative static CGE model, known as the Global Trade Anal- ysis Project (GTAP), developed by Purdue University. The project is widely used in the study of international trade disputes (Cui and Song, 2017; Itakura, 2014). To study the impact of energy 3085 "

Energy Reports 9 (2023) 30823095 Fig. 3. The basic structure of the production module in GTAP-E.
"sanctions on economies and energy trade, this paper uses the GTAP-E model. The GTAP-E model is an extended application of the GTAP standard model in the field of environment. The GTAP-E model incorporates energy as a factor input into the production structure, introduces carbon tax variables and carbon emissions trading mechanisms, and modifies the modules of production, consumption, carbon tax, and welfare decomposition. The basic structure of the specific production module is shown in Fig. 3."
"The production module of the GTAP-E model is embedded with multiple levels of conversion substituted elastic (CES) pro- duction functions, and capital and energy products can be substi- tuted for each other. The basic production factors of the GTAP-E model include not only land, labor, and natural resources, but also capitalenergy composite elements. Capital and energy can be substituted for each other, and this module uses the CES production function to characterize that if energy prices rise relative to capital prices, companies will replace capital inputs with energy products. Energy products are further divided into electricity and non-electricity composite elements, which can be further decomposed into coal, crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products, and each stage composite structure adopts the CES production function. Different from the traditional GTAP model, the GTAP-E model distinguishes the energy input in the production module from other non-energy intermediate inputs, considering the substitution of energy inputs with other basic production factors. On this basis, the GTAP-E model can accu- rately trace the energy consumption in the production process to investigate the economic-energy-carbon emission impact of policy changes. Therefore, the GTAP-E model is an important tool for energy policy and climate policy simulation."
"In the past, when simulating the EU-Russia energy embargo, scholars used the form of shock tariff variables (tms) to change the volume of a particular countrys trade in a specific commodity (Chepeliev et al., 2022). They directly transferred the tax revenue to the importing country. However, the energy game between the EU and Russia is mainly to now cut off energy trade between the two countries in the form of an executive order, so this paper divides the tariff revenue from the exporting country based on the import tariff adjustment to ensure that the simulation results are more realistic."
"3.2. Data The impact simulations in this study are based on GTAP-E data, the most recent data for the current period, and the simulation base period is 2014. The GTAP-E version of the database subdi- vides the world into 141 regions, each containing 65 production departments. To study the impact of the energy game between the EU and Russia on both sides and the worlds major countries, this paper divides the 141 countries in the database into the Euro- pean Union, Russia, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, India, the United States, the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), other Middle East and North Africa countries (XMN), OPEC member countries (OPEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the rest of the world (ROW). To study the heterogeneous impact of shocks on different levels of dependency, the 27 EU member states were classified as highly dependent (EUhdR), moderately reliant on Russian energy (EUmdR), and low dependent (EUldR) according to their dependence on Russian energy.1 1 National energy dependence: based on the percentage of total imports of fossil fuels from Russia."

Energy Reports 9 (2023) 30823095 Table 2 Energy sanctions and counter-sanctions scenario setting.
Scenario description S1 The EU cuts off coal imports from Russia.
S2 The EU cut off coal imports from Russia; Russia reduced its gas supply by 30%.
S3 The EU cut off coal imports from Russia; Russia reduced its gas supply by 50%.
S4 The EU cut off coal imports from Russia; EUldR and EUhdR ban the import of Russian crude oil and refined oil products; EUhdR reduce by 70%.
S5 The EU cut off coal imports from Russia; EUldR and EUhdR ban the import of Russian crude oil and refined oil products; EUhdR reduce by 70%; Russia reduced its gas supply by 80%.
S6 The EU and Russia cut off energy trade.
"To study the heterogeneous impact of energy trade restrictions on different industries in the EU and Russia, the 65 production sectors in the GTAP-E database were divided into 12 industry groups. At the same time, the energy game between the EU and Russia occurred in 2022, and the entry into force of sanctions on specific energy projects also happened in that year, so the base year of the simulation was set as 2022. However, the base year of the GTAP-E database is 2014, so the actual GDP, population, capital stock, and labor force data of the Econmap database of the French World Economic Research Center are used to dynamically recurse the data from 2014 to 2021, according to the research method (Ahmed et al., 2020)."
"3.3. Conflict scenarios setting As the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate, EU sanctions against Russia are also changing. Considering the energy trade structure of the two economies and the EUs energy sanctions, this article sets up six short-term scenarios, as shown in Table 2. From the perspective of the energy trade structure of the two major economies, the EU is highly dependent on Russian energy imports. In Russias trade structure, energy exports are the backbone of its economy. To sanction Russia for waging war in Ukraine, the EU has reduced or banned imports of Russian energy goods to combat its economy. In the scenario S1 setup, we set the EU to voluntarily cut off coal imports from Russia following the EUs Fifth package of sanctions proposed on April 8, 2022."
"In S2, Russia took countermeasures in response to EU energy sanctions. Since the EU highly depends on Russian natural gas energy, Russia will use natural gas exports as a countermeasure."
"Russia will reduce its gas exports to the EU by 30%. S3 said that Russia retaliated against the EU energy ban. If the EU strictly enforced the prohibition of Russian coal exports, Russia would reduce its gas exports to the EU by 50% in retaliation for various EU sanctions. In the S4 scenario, if the EU has not prevented the escalation of the situation in Russia and Ukraine after pass- ing previous sanctions against Russia. The EU will increase the sanctions based on the original sanctions. The new sanctions in- clude related products such as crude oil and refined oil products."
"Considering the different degrees of dependence of EU member states on Russian energy, the implementation of sanctions will vary. The EUldR and EUmdR countries in the EU will completely ban imports of Russian crude oil and refined oil products, but the EUhdR countries will reduce Russian crude oil and refined oil products imports by 70%. In the S5 scenario, Russia would reduce its natural exports to the EU by 80% in response to the escalation of EU sanctions. The S6 scenario simulates the extreme scenario of a two-way game, in which the EU completely bans energy products from Russia, and Russia cuts off gas exports to the EU."
"4. Results and discussion 4.1. Direct effects of energy sanctions 4.1.1. GDP and GDP deflator Table 3 shows the real GDP and GDP deflator changes in the EU regions, Russia, and corresponding world regions. A complete cessation of energy trade between the EU and Russia would lead to a 2.895% drop in world GDP. The shock results of different scenarios show that the impact on economies of whether or not to embargo oil and petroleum products varies widely. When the EU bans Russian coal in scenario S1, the economic damage to the EU is up to 0.099% and 0.891% to Russia. Russias counter- sanctions measures can blow the EU economy, but they cannot improve the economic losses caused by sanctions. Once the EU imposes sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, the economic losses to both sides will skyrocket. In the scenario of a hard decoupling of energy trade between the two sides (S6), the economic losses of the EU consortium would reach 1.488%, while the GDP losses of Russia would get 4.8%. In the game between the two sides, there is no economic winner, and the sanctions of both sides will cause economic damage to the other, but the economic losses for Russia will be higher. At the same time, other participants in this event, such as the members of the G7 group, have been less affected in the energy game between the EU and Russia (such as the United Kingdom, the highest loss is only 0.0712%), or even benefited. For example, the United States has maintained positive economic growth. As the game between the two sides intensifies, its economic growth degree has increased, reaching a maximum of 0.1165%."
"The change in the GDP deflator shows that energy sanctions will increase the cost of energy prices in EU member states, leading to higher inflation. Judging by the data on energy trade between the EU and Russia, the EUs energy consumption is highly dependent on Russian energy imports, especially natural gas. Therefore, the EUs sanctions on Russian energy will directly cause a massive gap in the energy supply, leading to a rapid rise in energy prices and production costs of energy-intensive industries. As seen in scenarios 1 to 3 from Table 4, the EU GDP deflator increased from 0.137% to 0.287%. As a sanctioned party, Russia suffered a decline of up to 0.442% in the GDP deflator due to setbacks in foreign trade, which may trigger deflation at home. This is only a scenario in scenarios S1S3 that does not involve sanctions on crude oil and crude oil products. If the EU imposes sanctions against Russias strict embargo on crude oil products, the impact on the price level of both sides will be huge. The EUs GDP deflator rose directly to 0.502%, while Russias GDP deflator fell instantly to 4.022%. The deflationary impact of sanctions on Russia will be stronger than the inflationary effect of the EU. Due to member states different degrees of dependence on Russian energy within the EU, there will be significant differences in the level of shocks. EU member states highly dependent on 3087 "

"At the same time, countries with low dependence will have a lower impact, which will also be a key factor affecting whether sanctions can be agreed upon in the EU. Looking at the effects of the EUs energy sanctions on Russia from the perspective of the international economy, we can draw a bare conclusion that is, the implementation of energy sanctions will directly promote the general rise in energy prices around the world, increasing the world GDP deflator."
"4.1.2. Changes in welfare levels In the GTAP model, changes in resident welfare are measured in the form of equivalent variation changes (EVs). EU energy sanc- tions against Russia will lead to losses in world welfare levels, up to 40,860.18 million dollars. After Russia suffers energy sanctions, the welfare of residents drops significantly, especially when crude oil and crude oil products are sanctioned, which has a significant negative impact on the welfare of residents in Russia. Through the decomposition of changes in the welfare of residents, the most critical factor affecting the decline in the welfare of Russian residents is the change in the terms of trade, which contributed more than 70% of the negative impact. The EUs complete cut- off of trade with Russian energy products (S6) will lead to a decline in EU residents welfare level by 13938.58 million dollars."
"Unlike the reasons for the decline in the welfare level of Russian residents, the reduction in the level of welfare of EU residents is due to allocative effects. The allocative effect is mainly generated by the impact of energy restrictions on regional production and household consumption. Due to the high dependence of the EU on Russia for energy consumption, the implementation of an energy ban will lead to a shortage of regional energy supply, making the supply of raw materials for energy-intensive industries insecure, so the output of the related industries will decline. Energy restric- tions will also cause the cost of living to rise rapidly. According to EU statistics, inflation in the EU region was as high as 9.6% in July 2022 after implementing energy restrictions. A rapid rise in the price index and a rapid decline in output in energy-intensive industries will lead to a significant decrease in household welfare."
"The increase in sanctions between the two sides will improve the welfare of residents of other energy export organizations, the most obvious of which is the EEU, the Eurasian Economic Union, as a Russian-led economic organization, played a role in energy re-export when Russia was sanctioned, and played a positive role in the trade export volume of member countries (see Table 5)."
"4.1.3. Changes in terms of trade and import trade The sanctions imposed by the EU and G7 member states have severely impacted Russias terms of trade(tot), and as the sanctions are carried out, the terms of trade of EU member states have also been damaged. As shown in Table 6, in the 3088 "

Due to restrictions on Russian energy im- ports and the impact of Russian countersanctions, the EUs tot continued to deteriorate in scenarios S2 and S3. Although Russias counter-sanctions have served the purpose of its policy, the cost is two-way, and it has adversely affected its tot. Suppose the EU strictly implements energy sanctions against Russia, which eventually leads to the interruption of energy trade between the two sides. In that case, it will significantly negatively impact the tot between the two sides. The EUs persistent energy supply shortage will have a contagion effect on the trade of other EU industries, such as energy-intensive industries, agriculture, chem- ical industries, etc., and the EUs tot will further deteriorate. For additional energy exporters, the energy game between the EU and Russia has caused international oil prices to rise, boosting their energy exports and incomes. To compensate for the energy gap, the EU has correspondingly reduced tariffs on energy imports from other countries, which has promoted the improvement of other countries tot to a certain extent."
"From the perspective of the impact of energy sanctions on the import and export trade of the two sides, both sanctions and countersanctions significantly impact the import and export trade of the two sides, mainly on exports for Russia and imports for EU member states. Implementing sanctions on energy im- ports by EU member states will directly reduce the total energy imports of the EU, which will reduce the total EU imports. In the simulation, total EU imports fell the most at S6, reaching 2.404%, shown in Table 7. Considering the practical dilemma of the EU in adjusting the energy trade structure in the short term, energy import restrictions will become the most significant hidden danger to the EUs energy security. The energy ban has an even more substantial impact on Russias import and export trade, with total imports falling by 6.23% and exports by 8.56% in the S6 scenario. According to the policy simulation results, EEU, an economic cooperation alliance led by Russia, has seen a significant increase in its import and export volume during the sanctions period. In the S6 scenario, EEU imports increased by 5.82%, and exports increased by 5.32%. Russia can transfer energy trade through the EEU and other countries. Although there is a change, the import and export of the rest of the worlds nations are insignificant."
"4.2. Indirect effects of energy sanctions 4.2.1. Energy trade transfer effects Fig. 4 shows the diversion effect of the energy ban on the EUs energy import trade. With the escalation of EU energy sanctions against Russia, energy trade between the two sides will decline significantly. In the S1 scenario, energy trade between the EU and Russia fell by 5.26% after EU sanctions on Russian coal imports."
"With the counter-sanction measures imposed by Russia, EU gas supplies will be limited, negatively impacting energy trade be- tween the two sides. In the S3 scenario, the EU energy trade with Russia will fall by 10.19%. There is no significant energy transfer 3089 "

"effect when sanctions are imposed only on Russian coal. The EUs energy market is still dominated by Russian energy, but there are also signs of energy transfer. In S3, Russias energy gap with the EU will be transferred to the EU through the EEU. At the same time, the EU will look for alternatives to Russias energy gap worldwide. The more significant phenomenon is that OPEC, XMN, and ROW account for a substantial increase in the EUs energy structure."
"The EU continues escalating energy sanctions against Russia, covering crude and crude oil products. Implementing these sanc- tions will have a non-negligible impact on the EUs short-term energy security and even lead to differences within the EU on sanctions against Russia. In scenario S4, energy trade between the EU and Russia would fall by 81.69%, and if Russia countersanc- tions against the EU by reducing gas supplies (S5), energy trade between the two would fall by 90.68%. The transfer effect map of energy trade shows that the imposition of severe sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products will significantly change the EUs energy structure. Russias share of the EUs energy mix is rapidly declining. The EU can only fill the gap in the energy market by increasing energy imports from other energy supply organizations. Russia will transfer exports to the EU through third-party channels, such as the Eurasian Economic Union. And Russia is also actively developing new energy exporters, such as India, China, and other non-Western world countries. In the process of EU sanctions against Russia, Russias foreign energy trade exports fell from 2.267% in the S1 scenario to 22.818% in the S6 scenario, which played a role in the sanctions against the Russian energy economy. In the simulation, other energy exporters can supplement the EUs energy demand. The total energy supply situation may be worse than the model scenario, so whether the EU will continue to impose energy sanctions on Russia will be decided based on the actual energy supply scenario."
"4.2.2. Energy trade transfer coefficient To study the impact of the EU energy ban on the flow of energy trade between the EU and Russia, we define the energy trade transfer coefficient with reference to the practice of Cui et al."
(2018). Use this indicator to find the countries and organizations with the most apparent energy trade diversion effect in sanctions.
"The EU energy trade import transfer factor is the increase in EU energy imports from third countries divided by the decrease in EU energy imports from Russia. This indicator measures the extent to which the EUs energy imports to other countries expand for ev- ery $1 reduction in EU energy imports from Russia. Similarly, the export transfer factor for Russian energy trade is defined as the increase in Russias energy exports to third countries divided by the decrease in Russias energy exports to the EU, which reflects the extent to which Russias energy exports to other countries expand for every $1 reduction in Russias energy exports to the EU."
"Fig. 5 shows the energy trade transfer coefficients between the EU and Russia in different scenarios. The import transfer coefficients of the EU energy trade are all positive, indicating that the EU has a shift in imports of energy trade. In each scenario, the expansion of EU energy imports from the USA, EEU, XMN, OPEC, and ROW is more pronounced. At the same time, the import transfer coefficient of the EU in scenarios S1S3 is significantly higher than that of energy imports in scenarios S4S6. Mainly due to the EUs sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products in the S4 scenario, the EUs energy imports from Russia have decreased rapidly, while the increase in imports from third coun- tries has grown at a low rate. This shows that if the EU imposes strict restrictions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, although it can make up for part of the energy gap by increasing the energy imports of third countries, the energy supply gap will still exist. Energy sanctions will force Russia to transfer more energy to Asian countries. Russias export expansion to CHN, IND, USA, EEU, ROW, and other regions is more prominent. This simulation is consistent with the real-world adjustment of the Russian energy export trade. According to OECD data, since the EU and G7 imposed sanctions on Russia, Russias crude oil and crude oil products exported to China have increased by about 55% year-on-year."
"4.3. The socioeconomic impact of the energy ban 4.3.1. Impact on residents The energy ban has had a significant negative impact on the worlds inhabitants. Most countries are plagued by inflation while developing countries also need to worry about the food crisis. The most affected are the two sides of the game. The chart below shows the impact of the EU energy ban on commodity prices on both sides. The energy ban imposed by the EU has brought intolerable inflation, especially in EU member states, which are highly dependent on Russian energy. In scenarios S1S3 shown in Fig. 6, the most significant increase in the price of various commodities in EU member states was natural gas, with gains of 4.22%, 3.42%, and 3.39%, and the costs of other items increased to a certain extent. Starting from scenario S4, the rise of com- modities in EU member states began to differ, and the prices of crude oil and crude oil products in EUhdR member countries began to rise rapidly, with the maximum price increase of crude oil products in scenario S6 reaching 20.32% and crude oil prices rising by 15.87%. Prices of other energy-related commodities have also risen significantly. In scenario S6, the electricity prices of EUhdR, EUmdR, and EUldR increased by 10.12%, 6.95%, and 6.77%, respectively. On August 18, 2022, Eurostat released data showing that the annual inflation rate in the EU and the eurozone reached 9.8% and 8.6%, respectively, in July 2022. The reality is that since the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia, energy and electricity prices in EU countries have risen even faster than the settlement results of the model. During this period, the cost of natcostgas, 3091 "

"which EU countries mainly rely on, has increased from an average of about 70 euros per megawatt hour per month in February 2022 to a maximum of 300 euros/MWh, an increase of 321.4%, while German electricity prices have exceeded the 700 euro mark for the first time, reaching a record 710 euros/MWh. The rise in energy prices in EU member states is consistent with, or even higher than, the models simulations, which include uncertain market expectations for the future EU-Russia energy game."
"According to the model simulation, the price of various do- mestic outputs in Russia will see a large-scale price decline due to the restriction of energy exports, among which the cost of energy commodities will fall most obviously. In scenario S6, the price of crude oil falls by 11.12%, the price of crude oil products falls by 9.32%, and the domestic economy should have severe deflation. But Russia has seen historical inflation, with the an- nualized inflation rate rising to 17.49% year-on-year in the week ending April 8, the highest since February 2002, according to the Russian Ministry of Economic Development. The main reason for this is the rapid and significant depreciation of the ruble."
Currency depreciation and the epidemics impact have caused Russian residents to reduce service consumption and increase consumption of physical goods.
"4.3.2. Impact on social output The energy ban has a heterogeneous impact on social output in the EU and Russia. The negative effect on the output of all sectors of society in the EU member states is consistent, and the impact on the output of the Russian industry is concentrated in the energy sector. The energy ban stimulates the exploitation of the EUs energy reserves. The implementation of the ban has allowed the EU to expand non-Russian energy imports while also turning its attention to internal energy resource reserves. As shown in Table 8, starting with scenario S1, the EUs coal sector output increased by 5.192% to address the gap in coal supply. And with the escalation of the energy ban, the output of the coal industry has maintained a high growth rate. In scenario S6, the coal sector output growth reached 9.434%. At this time, the increase in coal output is more to meet the electricity demand and alleviate the power supply shortage caused by natural gas and crude oil."
"The most apparent impact of the ban on EU industry output is the power sector, energy-intensive industries, and the output of crude oil products. In scenario S6, the output declines of the three sectors were 5.389%, 6.913, and 5.307, respectively. As the blood of modern industry, the lack of oil will cause the output of all societal sectors to suffer a negative impact. In addition to the obvious negative impact on industries with high energy tightness, the output of the GrainsCrops industry has also been significantly impacted, resulting in a 2.796% decline in industry output, mainly due to the decrease in the production in energy-intensive sectors such as fertilizers."
"The energy ban on Russian industry output is mainly concen- trated in the energy sector. At the beginning of the ban shown in Table 9, it led to a 14.105% drop in the output of the Russian coal industry. The escalation of the energy ban, it will have a significant impact on the output of Russian crude oil and crude oil products, resulting in a decline in output of 10.421% and 3.546%, respectively. From the perspective of changes in the output of other industries in Russia, in addition to the significant negative impact on the energy industry, the effect on the output of other sectors of society is small, and even the output of the industry has a positive promotion effect. Most notably, the output of energy- intensive industries increased by 14.295% in scenario S6. The main reason for this phenomenon is that when Russias energy exports encounter obstacles, in addition to opening up export markets outside the EU, it will also moderately reduce the output and export quota of energy resources and use the domestic indus- trial system to produce and process restricted commodities such as coal and crude oil through energy-intensive industrial systems such as chemical industry, and convert them into other forms of export, to circumvent the international communitys ban on energy exports."
"4.3.3. Impact on greenhouse gas emissions As shown in Table 10, in the short term, energy sanctions will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Simulations of GTAP10-E data show that world CO2 levels have decreased significantly with the escalation of energy sanctions, with world CO2 emissions falling by 10.053% in scenario S6 compared to pre-sanction levels."

The more dependent member states are on Russian energy; the more their carbon emissions will fall as energy restrictions come into effect. Among them, EUhdR countries fell by 4.139% in scenario S6 and EUldR by only 1.707%. Russias carbon emissions, on the other hand, have continued to rise with the increase in sanctions, with a maximum increase of 2.406%. This is related to Russias adjustment of in- dustrial output to solve its domestic demand and foreign trade after trade restrictions. The decline in the worlds carbon emission level is mainly due to the decrease in carbon emissions in the European Union, but this downward trend is not sustainable."
"The short-term energy gap has forced the EU to reduce carbon emissions in ways that limit economic activity and reduce resi- dents energy demand. In solving its energy woes and increasing the share of renewable energy, the EU may choose a cheaper but quicker approach: restart coal-fired thermal power plants that have been phased out. And this phenomenon is happening in most parts of the European Union. A vital part of the EUs energy transition package is using cheap natural gas in Russia."
"Without the support of Russian gas as a transition, it is difficult to achieve its transition goals by relying on renewable energy alone. If the energy game between the EU and Russia is not adequately resolved in the medium and long term, the purposes of a worldwide climate agreement will not be achieved."
5. Conclusion The geopolitical conflict caused by the RussianUkrainian war was not a dispute between the two countries in the first place.
"Through direct war between the two sides and indirect economic sanctions from the European Union, the worlds major economies have been directly involved in the vortex of conflict, especially when the world economy is recovering from the impact of the epidemic. As the main participants in this geopolitical conflict, the economic war between the European Union and Russia re- volves around energy sanctions and countersanctions. This study analyzes the impact of geopolitical conflicts on the EU, Russia, and global energy trade. We use the GTAP-E model to quantitatively evaluate the direct and transfer effects of the EU-Russia energy game by estimating and setting six scenario assumptions about the degree of energy trade between the EU and Russia. The research conclusions are mainly as follows: 1. Energy sanctions triggered by geopolitical conflicts will be a loselose or even multiple losses outcome. By simulating the different degrees of disruption in energy trade between the EU and Russia, as the energy game escalates, the economies of both sides will suffer serious negative shocks. In the scenario of a complete disruption of energy trade, the macroeconomic loss in the EU reached 1.488%, the Russian economy reached 4.801%, and the world economy experienced a decline of 2.895%. Under the trend of global trade integration, the energy game between major economies caused by geopolitical conflicts has led to the reshaping of the world energy trade structure. Energy sanctions will push up energy prices worldwide and increase the cost of energy trade between the two sides. It can be seen from the relative changes in terms of trade and import and export trade that the terms of trade of both sides of the sanctions will dete- riorate to varying degrees, with the terms of trade organized by the EU falling by 2.033% and the decline in Russias terms of trade reaching 5.151%. At the same time, the imports, and exports of the two major economies will also adjust significantly, with the EU showing a sharp decline in imports and Russia showing a decline in exports. From the perspective of economic development, the 3093 "

"2. Geopolitical conflicts will reshape the structure of world energy trade. As a strategic substance in the era of the industrial economy, energy is much more critical than other commodities."
"Energy security not only affects economic development but also is the foundation of social security and stability. By simulating energy trade between the EU and Russia, the strict implemen- tation of the energy ban will directly threaten the EUs energy security. The energy sanctions between the two sides are divided by whether to sanction crude oil and crude oil products. Sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products will directly affect the energy trade structure of EU member states and cause strong countermeasures from Russia. After the sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, the EU must look for alternatives to Russian energy worldwide. The more significant phenomenon is that OPEC, XMN, and ROW account for a substantial increase in the EUs energy structure. The calculation of the energy trade transfer factor also supports this conclusion. At the same time, after the setback in energy exports to the EU, Russia will turn its market to countries such as China, India, and the ASEAN Organization. In the model, both the EU and Russia can reduce the impact of the energy ban on both sides by rapidly adjusting their import and export destinations. Still, due to geopolitical games and high levels of world economic uncertainty, this energy trade structural adjustment may not have the desired effect in the short term."
"3. The level of social welfare and ecology should not become victims of political games. In geopolitical conflicts, the inhabitants become the bearers of the outcome of political games and wars."
Russias war against Ukraine and the energy ban imposed by the European Union have caused immeasurable losses to residents.
"The most direct impact of the energy ban on residents of EU member states is the increase in energy prices. The difference in the dependence of EU member states on Russian energy has led to a large difference in the impact of energy bans on residents. In the S6 situation, the electricity prices of EUhdR, EUmdR and EUldR increased by 10.12%, 6.95%, and 6.77% respectively, increasing the cost of electricity prices for residents and causing greater survival pressure on the residents at the bottom. Energy shortages will also affect output across sectors in the EU. The direct effect of the decline in total social output is the loss of residents welfare level, and the indirect effect is the decline in carbon emissions of the whole society. While carbon emissions will decline in the short term due to restrictions on economic activity, in the medium to long term, it will have a profound impact on the worlds energy transition, and governments may make energy security a strategic goal and abandon the Sustainable Development Goals."
"4. Reshaping energy trade networks will directly affect the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The terms of energy trade directly determine the stability of international en- ergy prices, and energy consumption prices directly affect the production costs of enterprises. The major countries that have announced the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals have all involved a transformation of their energy con- sumption structure, based on the basic premise that relatively cheap and clean natural gas is used as a transitional energy source. The uncertainty of world energy trade caused by the energy game directly pushes up energy prices worldwide. In an economic environment with high energy prices, the fiscal and monetary policies of governments around the world to promote sustainable development at the macro level will be greatly re- duced, while the micro-enterprise level will be driven by its own interests and risks to reduce investment in green innovation."
"Therefore, carbon emissions from short-term economic down- turns do not contribute to medium- and long-term sustainable development."
"This study bridges the gap between geopolitical theory and energy trade practice. However, this paper, like similar literature, is limited by the analytical framework of the model and fails to study the logic between geopolitics, energy trade, and sustainable development goals at the micro level. This study only studies the changes in energy games caused by geopolitical conflicts on economic growth, aggregate output, energy trade diversion effects, social welfare losses, and carbon emission levels at the macro level. In the short term, at the cost of economic losses, the carbon emission target has been exceeded, but a study of the production level of micro-enterprises shows that the instability of energy trade has a very negative impact on the medium- and long-term green transformation of enterprises. Therefore, in the future, we will conduct a more detailed micro-level study on the relationship between energy trade and sustainable development goals, to provide a more complete theoretical and practical basis for sustainable development."

"Peer-reviewed research  The Impact of the Russia-Ukraine War on the Cryptocurrency                    Market    Isaac Appiah-Otoo  1    a  1Business Administration, College of Management Science, Chengdu University of Technology, Chengdu, China  Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Russia-Ukraine war, JEL: C01 G12 H56  https://doi.org/10.46557/001c.53110  Asian Economics Letters  Vol. 4, Issue 1, 2023  This research provides the very first empirical investigation of the impact of the  Russia-Ukraine war on the cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin trading volume, and returns)."
The findings indicate that the Russia-Ukraine war impedes Bitcoin trading volume. A 1%  increase in the Russia-Ukraine war leads to a 0.2% reduction in Bitcoin trading volume.
"The findings also indicate that the impact is more pronounced during the post-invasion  period, especially after one week of the invasion. Finally, the Russia-Ukraine war predicts  Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run."
"I. Introduction      Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, following  a prolonged period of military deployment along Ukraines  borders (Boungou & Yati, 2022). According to Statista, the  war has resulted in the deaths of 4, 677 civilians and the  displacement of over 8 million people as of 23 June 2022."
"1  The conflict has impacted the global economy, food secu rity, and geopolitics (Pereira et al., 2022). In the financial  market, the recent conflict has impacted stock market re turns (Boubaker et al., 2022; Boungou & Yati, 2022), com modity market (Appiah-Otoo, 2022), and corporate deci sions (Tosun & Eshraghi, 2022). However, it is unknown  whether the war has had any influence on the cryptocur rency market, especially Bitcoin trading volume and re turns."
"Cryptocurrencies are appealing to investors since they  are frequently seen as a safe haven investment (Cheng  & Yen, 2020). Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency,  has piqued the curiosity of investors, the public, and schol ars (Kalyvas et al., 2020). Several researchers have recently  demonstrated how Bitcoin possesses hedging capabilities  towards economic instability (Mokni et al., 2020), and may  be used as a hedge and safe haven across currencies (Ka lyvas et al., 2020). It could also be used as a hedge amid  certain market circumstances (Cheng & Yen, 2020). Fur thermore, using Bitcoin in investment portfolios has been  demonstrated to provide significant gains as well as boost  risk-adjusted outcomes (Brire et al., 2015). To this end, the  objective of this study is to explore the impact of the ongo ing Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading volume and re turns. Understanding this link will aid investors and asset  managers in determining an optimal asset allocation strat egy and hedging choices."
"Following Boungou and Yati (2022), this study first ex amines the effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin  trading volume and finds that the Russia-Ukraine war im pedes Bitcoin trading volume. It then examines how Bitcoin  trading volume responded to the period before the invasion  (pre-invasion i.e., 23 January to 23 February 2022) and the  period after the invasion (post-invasion i.e., 24 February to  16 April 2022), and finds that the impact of the conflict on  Bitcoin trading volume is more pronounced in the post-in vasion period. Furthermore, the study explores whether the  impact differed during the first week of the invasion (24  February 2022 to 3 March 2022) and after the first week  of the invasion (4 March 2022 to 16 April 2022) and finds  that the impact of the conflict on Bitcoin trading volume  is greater after the first week of the invasion. Finally, the  study demonstrates that the Russia-Ukraine war predicts  Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run."
"The study adds to the growing body of knowledge about  the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the financial mar ket by presenting the very first empirical investigation of  the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the cryptocurrency  market. This study also adds to the voluminous literature  on the determinants of Bitcoin trading volume and returns  (Mokni et al., 2020; Panagiotidis et al., 2018; Wang et al.,  2022; Wu et al., 2022) by also presenting the impact of the  Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading volume and returns."

"II. Data and Methodology          A. Data      This study examines the impact of the Russia-Ukraine  war on Bitcoin trading volume and returns. Regarding the  impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading vol ume, the study uses panel data of twenty countries 2 with  dates ranging from 23 January 2022 to 16 April 2022. Al though the war began on 24 February 2022, many global  leaders had long planned for it and felt it was only a matter  of time until it began (Boungou & Yati, 2022), therefore  justifying the studys start from 23 January 2022. The coun tries are also chosen based on the availability of data. Coin  dance (https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins) serves as  the source of the Bitcoin trading volume data, while Google  Trends serves as the source for the Russia-Ukraine war data  (https://trends.google.com/trends). This study conducts a  90-day search using the terms Russia and Ukraine and  war. The first differences of the natural logarithm of Bit coin prices are used to generate the time-series data on  Bitcoin returns. Except for Bitcoin returns, we log-trans form all the variables to show the results as elasticities and  to provide efficient outcomes (Appiah-Otoo, Song, et al.,  2022)."
"B. Methodology      To examine the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on  Bitcoin trading volume, the study estimates the following  model:  where   denotes Bitcoin trading volume;   de notes the Russia-Ukraine war; and  represents the error  term. Country and time are represented by  and  We ex pect  to be positive and statistically significant. This is  because Bitcoin possesses hedging capabilities toward eco nomic instability (Mokni et al., 2020)."
We estimate Equation (1) using the IV-GMM method.
"This method is suitable for the estimation of Equation (1)  given the small period, a large number of countries, omit ted variables, and the issues of endogeneity (Appiah-Otoo,  Acheampong, et al., 2022; Appiah-Otoo & Song, 2021). We  also use the fixed effects (FE) method for robustness test ing. This method also addresses country-specific fixed ef fects issues."
"To also scrutinise the influence of the Russia-Ukraine  war on Bitcoin returns, we use a quantile regression. Quan tile regression has the advantage of estimating conditional  average performance models using numerous additional  conditional quantile functions (Zeinedini et al., 2022)."
"Quantile regression can also produce an additional all-in clusive numerical examination of the randomized connec tions amid regressors (Koenker & Hallock, 2001)."
"The model is stated as follows:  where   signifies Bitcoin returns     is the natural log arithm of the Russia-Ukraine war   and  indicates  the error term. Time is denoted by t;  is the constant term,  while  is the quantile   of the conditional distri bution."
"III. Results and discussion          This section presents the results. Table 1 shows the re sults on the effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin  trading volume. The full sample period results based on the  IV-GMM and FE techniques show that the war impedes Bit coin trading volume. A 1% rise in the Russia-Ukraine war  leads to a 0.247% reduction in Bitcoin trading volume ac cording to the IV-GMM estimates, while a 1% rise in the  Russia-Ukraine war leads to a 0.784% reduction in Bit coin trading volume according to the FE estimates. Thus,  Bitcoin trading volume remains sensitive to the Russia- Ukraine war. This conflicts with our expectations but aligns  with previous studies that document uncertainties to im pede Bitcoin growth (Mokni et al., 2020). Thus, Bitcoin re mains a speculative asset."
"Turning to the pre- and post-invasion periods, the IV- GMM estimates indicate that the war has a negative effect  on Bitcoin trading volume in both periods; however, the  negative effect is only significant in the post-invasion pe riod. The pre-invasion findings are collaborated by the FE  estimates, albeit statistically significant, while the post-in vasion findings remained contradictory. These differences  could be attributed to the fact that the IV-GMM technique  resolves endogeneity issues, while the FE does not."
"Moving to the weeks of the invasion results in Table 2,  we observe that the Russia-Ukraine war has a negative and  statistically significant impact on Bitcoin trading volume  only after the first week of the invasion, based on the IV- GMM technique."
"Table 3 shows the Bitcoin returns results. The Russia- Ukraine war has a positive and statistically significant effect  on Bitcoin returns in the 20th quantile, while it has a neg ative and statistically significant effect on Bitcoin returns  in the 70th quantile. Thus, the Russia-Ukraine war predicts  Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run. Thus, in vestors should take into consideration the Russia-Ukraine  war when allocating assets and designing hedging strate gies in the Bitcoin market. Also, policymakers should devise  strategies to help combat the adverse impact of the Russia- Ukraine war on the Bitcoin market."
Figure 1 displays a plot of the quantile regression results  for the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin returns.
The figure shows that the Russia-Ukraine war has a neg ative effect on Bitcoin returns on average across all the  quantiles.

"IV. Conclusion      This study examines the impact of the Russia-Ukraine  war on the cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin trading volume  and returns). The findings indicate that the Russia-Ukraine  war impedes Bitcoin trading volume. The findings also in dicate that the impact is more pronounced during the post- invasion period, especially after one week of the invasion."
"Finally, the Russia-Ukraine war impedes Bitcoin returns in  the long-run  This study focuses only on Bitcoin given its popularity  and dominance. Future studies should use alternative cryp tocurrencies to re-estimate these associations. Future stud ies should also explore the causal association between the  Russia-Ukraine war and Bitcoin trading volume and re turns. Finally, a more recent dataset can be employed to  validate these findings."

1          Market Reactions to the RussianUkraine War:                  A Global Banking Stock Analysis          Abstract    Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the market reactions of the banking industry to  the RussianUkraine war.
"Design/methodology/approach This paper uses an event study methodology, regression  analyses and interaction effects to study the effect of the war on banks stock prices and analyze  factors that explain the cumulative abnormal return."
"Findings First, this study finds a significant decline of almost 1.5% in return on the war date."
"Similar patterns were observed for all continents, but Europe had the most severe drop of about  4%. Second, after excluding the contemporaneous influence of the whole market using the  market model, global bank equities returns fell by about 1% on the war date, indicating that  bank stocks were more severely impacted by the war than the average stock market. Net-of- market return approach further reveals that bank stock prices decreased 1.4% more on the event  day compared to the pre-war market average. Third, the impacts of the war and sanctions were  persistent when the war continued. Banks stocks were most hit in Europe, Asia and North  America."
"Originality/value This paper pioneers the study of the effect of the RussiaUkraine war on  the banking industry. This paper also analyzes the reaction pattern of bank stocks before, during  and after the war to explain the behavior and expectations of investors toward the war."

"2    1. Introduction  The Russia-Ukraine war1 has heightened global financial stability risks2 (ECB, 2022) as it  harmfully and virtually affects all aspects of economic activities and financing conditions (e.g.,  energy prices, inflation, economic growth). The situation has worsened in the European  countries since the war, and related sanctions further put more pressure on energy and  commodity prices3. As this region relies heavily on the Russian energy supply, which accounts  for approximately 43% of its natural gas and 27% of its crude oil imports in 2020, European  financial stability is severely harmed by this rising inflation. Correspondingly, banks and  creditors are now tightening their financing conditions, making them struggle with the  increasingly indebted firms due to Covid19 and lowering their own revenue and profits. The  banking sector, especially in Europe, has therefore faced weaker profitability (ECB, 2022). In  the US, BNY Mellon had a drop of 3% in fee revenue (equivalent to $3.2 billion) in the first  quarter of 2022, and $88 million of this loss is caused by the sanctions against Russia4. Those  banks inescapably confront an increasingly uncertain environment caused by the war, the  volatile markets, and persistently higher inflations across countries."
"Although there is some evidence of the market reaction to global stocks, we still find a gap in  which we can provide new evidence and significantly contribute to the war-related literature."
"To our knowledge, existing evidence only focuses on non-financial firms' stocks (e.g., Tosun  and Eshraghi, 2022; Boungou and Yati, 2022; Boubaker et al., 2022; Umar et al., 2022b;  Yousaf et al., 2022). Unfortunately, they cannot be applied to international banking  institutions due to their unique intermediation model 5 and central role in some sanctions."
"1 February 24, 2022  2 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.pr220525~fa1be4764d.en.html   3 https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/financial-stability/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202205~f207f46ea0.en.html#toc4  4 https://www.americanbanker.com/list/5-ways-the-ukraine-war-is-impact-the-banking-industry   5 Mishkin (1999) underlined the crucial role of banks as intermediaries in ensuring the stability of financial  markets. Furthermore, banking is a sector with a high level of risk contagion (Gorton, 1985; Iyer & Peydr, 2011;  "
"3    Indeed what distinguishes banks from non-financial firms is the spill-over effect on global  financial and commodity markets (Batten et al., 2022; Choudhury et al., 2022; Hassan et al.,  2022b; Hassan et al., 2022b; Karim et al., 2022), as commercial banks play a facilitation role  in transactions and providing credit in the modern economy. Under such high uncertainty and  the nature of the war crisis, the banking system's ability to withstand the economic  repercussions of systemic risk-induced adverse events is even more critical. Hence, severe  instability in the banking sector due to the war may be a shock hitting the whole financial  system and wreaking havoc on economies worldwide. The above-mentioned crucial role and  special characteristics of banks during uncertain times motivate us to investigate the reaction  of bank stocks to the war."
"The event's impact on banks can be determined using accounting data. However, the mere  availability of accounting data at low frequencies, such as quarterly, limits the flexibility to  examine the effect pattern of events in a timely manner (Tinoco & Wilson, 2013). On the  contrary, stock prices have the advantage of quickly reflecting the systemic risks (Rees, 1995),  including information about risk and cash flows that are not included in the financial statements  (Hillegeist et al., 2004; Beaver et al., 2005; Agarwal & Tafler, 2008). Therefore, in this study,  we focus on the reaction of bank stock prices to the war event."
"The market reactions of global banking stocks to the Russian-Ukraine war may be due to  several factors, including investors' fear and expectations (Duxbury et al., 2020; & Galloppo,  2018; Liang, 2018) about the war's consequences and market outlook towards this sector 6 7."
"In addition, the literature emphasizes the impacts of inflation on banks' profitability  expectations. Specifically, higher inflation heightens the possibility of interest rate                                                          Kaufman, 1994; Slovin et al., 1999). Hence, the response of the banking system to the war event will reveal the  financial system's vulnerability as a whole."

"4    adjustments. As a result, the values of bonds and stocks are expected to diminish following  rising interest rates (Ehrmann & Fratzscher, 2004; Malkiel, 1962; Thorbecke, 1997; Tobin,  1978), hence decreasing the value of banks' assets and increasing their risk. The literature has  long supported the negative impact of inflation on bank profitability (Kessel & Alchian, 1960;  Dermine, 1985; Lajeri & Dermine, 1999)."
"The Russian-Ukraine war is worth researching because this current event has led to the global  coordination of several influential sanctions from different areas, typically the European Union  (J.J.Morgan 8 ). To date, as mentioned earlier, little academic evidence focuses on the  implications of the Russia-Ukraine war event and border disputes on stock markets (Tosun and  Eshraghi, 2022; Boungou and Yati, 2022; Boubaker et al., 2022; Umar et al., 2022b; Yousaf  et al., 2022), or the effect of this crisis on the European stock market (Ahmed et al., 2022)."
"However, those studies only cover the general (or non-financial) stock market indices and  ignore the effects on banking, which is one of the most influenced sectors by the war. Our  present study fills this critical void of war event study."
"In addition, our study contributes to the psychological literature on responses to anticipated  realities (e.g., Laurin, 2018; Kim & Verrecchia, 1991) by testing the hypothesis that bank  stocks react to the anticipated event. By doing so, we found the different reactions of stock  return and the war before and after the war event day. Particularly, we investigate if the bank  stock market strongly reacts on the war day. The Ukraine-Russia war was not an unexpected  event9. Brickman (1978) reveals that when an event is anticipated to occur, but its repercussions  are still insignificant, people have little psychological conviction that the event will occur. In  addition, Laurin (2018) claims that as the probability of an event increases, especially when its                                                          8 https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/research/russia-ukraine-crisis-market-impact   9 http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/67828    "
"5    consequences begin to emerge, psychological realism will boost rationalization. Consequently,  the transition from anticipated feeling to real feeling should cause an increase in people's  rational reactions. Hence, people will strongly respond on the day of the occurrence."
"Our study, the main focus on global banking stocks, significantly contributes to the geopolitical   literature and practice of the banking sector (Baur & Smales, 2020; Engle & Campos-Martins,  2023; Sharif et al., 2020). Substantial credit was given to our more in-depth and differential  results compared to the studies on non-financial firms' stocks. First, we document a shred of  new insightful evidence on the strong reaction of bank stock return to the war on the day of the  war. Similar patterns were observed for all six continents, but Europe had the most severe drop  in return on the first day of the war. That means we find that not all parts of the world had a  similar experience right after the war was begun. Interestingly, we also show the different  reactions of the banking sectors to the war news and its related events before, during, and after  the war."
"Second, we contribute to the current literature on war event and financial market (Tosun and  Eshraghi, 2022; Boungou and Yati, 2022; Boubaker et al., 2022; Umar et al., 2022b; Yousaf  et al., 2022; Ahmed et al., 2022) by examining the magnitude and coverage of the war's effect  on bank stocks by focusing on the significance of this fall when market risk is considered. This  in-depth analysis shows the standard impact (signs) and, more importantly, the extent of the  market reactions on the global banking stocks. To do this, we calculate the abnormal return of  the bank stocks using two alternative approaches: the market model (AR1) (Biakowski et al.,  2012; Brown & Warner, 1985) and net-of-market return (AR2) (Brown & Warner, 1985). Both  methods help capture the performance of bank stocks after filtering out the contemporary  movement of the whole stock market."
"6    Third, we examine the reaction of bank stocks to war-related events from the perspective of  behavioral finance, specifically, overreaction (Ardia et al., 2022; Bondt & Thaler, 1987; Lou  & Polk, 2022). Europe was the region in which bank stock losses were the most severe. This  is consistent with the fact that Europe's economy relies substantially on imports from Russia,  particularly energy and commodities. In the event of a war, disruptions to international trade  and increased energy costs will directly impact European consumption and production,  diminishing the profitability and raising the risks of banks in these nations. The response  pattern of European bank stocks mirrors this anxiety. Europe is the area with the strongest  evidence of market overreaction on the day of the war and the most robust evidence of market  reversal the next day. Our results are consistent with prior literature on investor sentiment and  the overreaction hypothesis (Bondt and Thaler, 1985). Existing literature suggests that investor  sentiment swings following major-specific events (Edmans et al., 2007; Kadiyala and Rau,  2004), and overreaction is an important part of the price behavior during the crash (Seyhun,  1990). There was also evidence of overreactions and reversals at times of heightened tensions  before the war and when oil prices jumped after the war. This suggests that investors in this  region are more sensitive to the development and ramifications of Russia and Ukraine tensions."
"Finally, we investigate how the war's repercussions have altered investor expectations for bank  equities. We are primarily concerned with two war-related effects: the rise in energy costs and  the change in currency strength. Our result suggests that, following the war, bank stocks  become significantly more susceptible to oil price and exchange rate fluctuations. This finding  contributes to the literature on the negative relationship between oil price and stock price during  the post-war period (Jones & Kaul, 1996), the positive correlation between market returns and  oil demand shocks, and the negative correlation between market return and oil supply shocks  (Kilian & Park, 2009; Ready, 2018), the international evidence of oil shocks impacting stock  markets (Basher and Sadorsky, 2006; Ftiti et al., 2016; Umar et al., 2022a), the impact of oil  "
"7    price on bank profitability (Poghosyan & Hesse, 2009; Ma el al., 2021). We also find evidence  that bank stocks in Europe, Asia, and South America were more sensitive to the exchange rate  swings following the war. This result is in line with the documented close association between  stock performance and exchange rate risk in the literature (Dornbusch and Fischer, 1980;  Phylaktis and Ravazzolo, 2005; Kinateder et al., 2021), the tightening relationship around the  period of crisis (Phylaktis and Ravazzolo, 2005). We also provide more international evidence  for the literature on banking exposure to exchange rate risk (Chamberlain et al., 1997; Martin  and Meuer, 2003). Overall, our findings suggest that energy prices and fluctuations in exchange  rates could be the channels for the effects of war and sanctions to spread to bank stocks."
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and sample  construction. Section 3 introduces the methodology and variable definitions. Sections 4 and 5  present our main findings and potential channels for transferring the war impact to bank stock  returns. Section 6 concludes our paper.
"2. Data and Sample  Our study employs data from four sources: media outlets, Refinitiv Datastream, Refinitiv  Eikon, and Barchart. We acquire relevant information about the Russia-Ukraine war event from  many trustful sources on the internet 10 and multiple-check for validation. Accordingly, we  assume the official announcement time for the war is when Putin declared the ""special military  operation"" against Ukraine via televised broadcasting just before 6 a.m., Moscow time, on  February 24, 2022. At this time, the stock markets in Oceania and Asia are still open for trading  on February 24, while the markets in North America, South America, Europe, and Africa are  already closed for trading on February 23 and preparing to open for the next trading day. Hence,  we define the first trading day following the war as February 24, 2022, across the globe."
"10 The New York Times, WHO, ..."
"8    Next, we obtain the commercial bank stock data from Refinitiv Datastream. This data source  provides us with 2316 commercial banks from 90 markets covering six continents: Europe,  Asia, North America, South America, Oceania, and Africa. We do not include Russian banks  in our sample since we are primarily concerned with the impact of the war on bank stocks in  countries that are not directly involved in this war. Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of  our sample, including investigated markets, their regions, continents, and the number of  commercial banks examined in each market."
"[Insert Table 1 about here]  To measure abnormal returns, we gather market returns data from Refinitiv Eikon."
"Market return for each market is proxied using the most commonly used benchmark indexs  return in this market. Next, we control for the impact of coronavirus by employing the daily  number of new data cases retrieved from the WHO website. Due to the timing of the Covid 19 outbreak and the war, we restrict our sample from January 2020 to April 2022. Further, we  gather sanction information from the internet to examine the effects of the major sanctions. Our  study also considers the impact of the war via the fluctuation in energy prices proxied by the  WTI crude oil price and the ups and downs of currency power measured using the exchange  rate for each market. The crude oil price and exchange rates data are collected from  Barchart.com."
"3. Event study methodology and variable definitions  We follow the approach of Fama et al. (1969) to investigate the impact of the war event on  bank stock returns. We measure each bank stock's abnormal return using two different  methods: the market model (Biakowski et al., 2012; Binder, 1998; Campbell et al., 2012;  Abudy et al., 2022) and the net-of-market return (Brown & Warner, 1985; Campbell et al.,  2012; Abudy et al., 2022)."
"9    Following the market model approach, we estimate the expected returns by regressing each  actual stock return series on the corresponding market return. To prevent the confounding  effect of the covid19 pandemic fear and vaccine distribution event at the end of 2020, we  restrict our sample to start from March 2021. Specifically, the market model is estimated from  230 days to 11 days before the war. Based on the estimated result, the abnormal return of each  stock is measured as follows:  , (1) = .( +  . ,)                                                (1)  where . is the actual return of stock i and , is the corresponding market return on the day  t.   and   are the coefficients estimated from the market model."
"The second method, net-of-market return, measures the abnormal returns as the difference  between actual return against the average historical market return (Brown & Warner, 1985)."
"The literature has documented potential day-of-week seasonality patterns in stock prices, such  as the Monday effect (French, 1980; Kamara, 1997) or the weekday effect (Ke et al., 2007;  Doyle & Chen, 2009). To account for this potential weekday effect, we measure the abnormal  return of a stock as the difference between the actual stock return and the average  corresponding historical market return on the same weekday. Formally, we calculate the  following specification:   , (2) = . , same weekday between T11 and T230.                                             (2)  To reduce the idiosyncratic movement of each bank stock return, we compute the daily global  or regional average abnormal return (AAR) as the average abnormal return of all bank stocks  worldwide or in the examined region. Specifically,   =     ,                                                              (3)  "
"10    Further, we also calculate the cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) from the day 1 to  day 2 as the sum of the daily average abnormal return within this time window. The CAAR  analysis is necessary because it helps reveal how long the event influences bank stocks' returns."
"(1, 2) =   2 =1                                                   (4)  4. Main results  4.1 Bank stocks' return movement following the war event."
"We begin our analysis by examining the movement of the bank stock return throughout the  sample period. We also employ the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter to better capture bank stocks'  performance patterns and separate long-term trends from short-term fluctuations. Figure 1  depicts the movement of all commercial banks' returns for the entire world and each region  from January 2020 to April 2022. The blue line shows the average bank stock return, while the  red line represents the long-term trend obtained using the HP filter."
"[Insert Figure 1 about here]  It can be seen from Figure 1 that the bank stock return around the world reacted to the war  event.  During 2020, global banking stocks witnessed a tumultuous period. From the beginning  of 2021, the return volatility pattern appears more stable with a flatter long-term trend line."
"However, there was an abrupt drop in return on the day of the war. This average decline of  almost 1.5 percent is severe compared to the market's moves at the beginning of 2022 and the  pattern over the last year. This indicates that the market's precipitous decline on February 24,  2022, was most likely triggered by the day's incident."
"Similar patterns were observed for all six continents. Amongst them, Europe had the most  severe return decline on the first day of the war. The average return of bank stocks fell more  than 4%, becoming the most profound fall since mid2020. Notably, European banking stocks  "
"11    have relatively low volatility in 2021, with a maximum average drop of no more than 2%."
"Compared with other regions, Europe is the market with the strongest bank stocks' reaction in  both magnitude and comparison with the preceding trend. The strong market reaction on the  day of the war lends credence to the notion that expectations for European bank equities are  highly sensitive to this war."
The fear of the war's repercussions might explain the strong reaction of European bank stocks.
"Western nations had threatened Russia with sanctions if the war materializes. These sanctions  are anticipated to significantly impact numerous European banks conducting international  banking activities related to Russia. In addition, war and sanctions increase concerns of  disruptions in international trade, escalating commodity prices, and increasing financial  instability. These factors potentially influence the future cash flow and risk of banks. The  reaction of the market to bank stocks is not limited to Europe. Oceania and Asia also  experienced a sharp drop in bank stocks' returns on the first day of the war. North American  bank stocks showed a noticeable but weakest reaction across the region. South America and  Africa also saw marked declines in bank stocks' performance on the day of the war. In general,  bank stocks on the six continents all saw steep decreases on the day of the war. These losses  are extreme compared to the trend of fluctuations over the preceding year. This suggests that  the Russia-Ukraine war considerably impacts investor sentiment towards bank stocks. This  impact has a worldwide scope and is strongest in the European region."
4.2 The magnitude and coverage of the war's effect on bank stocks worldwide.
"The decline in actual bank stocks' returns implies the war's impact on the bank stocks. To  facilitate this analysis, we calculate the bank stocks' abnormal return using the market model  (AR1) and net-of-market return (AR2). Table 2 reports the average abnormal returns (AAR) of  "
12    bank stocks on the first day of the war for the entire world and six continents. This table also  presents the test result for whether the AARs for the globe and each area are different from 0.
"[Insert Table 2 about here]  Panel A of Table 2 reports the average abnormal returns from the market model. On the war  day, global bank stock returns plummeted by around 1%. This decline is statistically  significant, with a t-stat of 8.85, implying that bank stocks, in general, were further affected  by the war, adding to the effect of the overall market decline. Panel B of Table 2 displays the  net-of-market abnormal return. The results show a similar result compared to the market model  approach; bank stocks worldwide fell 1.4% deeper on the day of the war with a t-stat of 17.63."
These results from the average abnormal return from both methods are consistent with the  downward trend in bank stock returns in Figure 1.
"Table 2 also depicts the widespread impact of the war on various geographical areas. In all  continents, significant drops in average abnormal returns were recorded. Regardless of the  methods employed, Europe is always the hardest-hit region. Bank stock returns in Europe  significantly fell 2.17% or 4.146% on the event day according to the market model or the net- of-market abnormal return approaches. This decline supports the view that investor sentiment  towards European bank stocks is very vulnerable to war. Noticeably, the drops in returns in  Europe were always about double Asia, the second-most affected region."
"Furthermore, to investigate whether this event has a large-scale impact on most banks or only  focuses on some banks, we calculate the percentage of banks with negative abnormal returns."
"Table 3 reports the results for all regions. The results reveal that over 94% of banks worldwide  had returns below the market average in the pre-war period, and Europe is still the most affected  region, with more than 90% of banks being hit on the war day. When the market influence is  removed, 43% of banks had negative abnormal returns."
"13    [Insert Table 3 about here]  4.3 How did bank stocks react to the war, war-related news, and the persistence of  reaction?  The sharp drop in bank stock returns on the first day of the war illustrates the sensitivity of  bank stocks to this event. However, there are some concerns over the market response. First,  did fear of the war's consequences affect investor sentiment before the war started? Second, if  this war is anticipated, is the reaction of bank stocks on the war event day purely an  overreaction of the market or a correction of the expectation of bank stocks when the war  materialized? To address these concerns, we calculate the abnormal return of bank stocks from  10 days before the war event to 10 days after. Table 4 reports the results for all areas."
"[Insert Table 4 about here]  In the ten trading days before the war, bank stocks experienced both price increases and  decreases. However, the average gains and losses in the global bank stocks over the ten days  before the war are relatively small, ranging from 1.41% to 0.2%. This indicates that the drop  on February 24 is not due to the continuation of the trend in the last ten days but is highly likely  due to the day's event. The same pattern was observed in all six continents when the drops on  the war day were extreme compared with the fluctuations in the last ten days."
"The war between Russia and Ukraine does not come as a surprise to the market. Fear  of this war existed already. Between late 2021 and January 2022, Russia sent troops close to  the Ukrainian border, raising worries of an imminent war. From this time forwards, the United  States and its Western allies warned about sanctions against Russia. In addition, the impasse  over settling a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukrain conflict fueled fears of consequences  if war started. On February 14, the United States closed its embassy in Kyiv, heightening  "
"14    concerns that war was inevitable. On the same day, the White House also broadcasted a  message that the war could happen anytime. The prospect of this impending war severely  impacted the markets on the same day. Table 4 demonstrates that bank stocks performed poorly  in most areas on February 14. The AAR for European bank stocks was the lowest, at 0.71%  (t-stat = 10.36), further than the impact of the whole market. The same day, Asia, North  America, and South America also experienced significant negative abnormal returns. Due to  being in the earliest time zone, Oceania's market reacted a day later, while African bank stocks  exhibited no considerable reaction."
"A similar reaction was witnessed on February 22. On February 21, tensions escalated  when Russia recognized the independence of two regions in Ukraine, followed by a series of  sanctions imposed by Western countries in late February 21 and the following days. Rising  tensions and the series of sanctions made the market react more negatively on February 22."
"Energy prices surged on February 22 after Russia sent troops into eastern Ukraine. Europe and  other regions that support imposing sanctions on Russia are under pressure from disruptions to  international trade and inflation resulting from higher energy and commodity costs. These  consequences are harmful to the profitability of banks. Pressure from rising commodity prices  also affects regions with high importing levels, such as Asia. AARs of 0.5% (t-stat = 3.28)  in Asia, 0.14% (t = 2.31) in Europe, and negative for all remaining areas reinforce the view  that bank stocks reacted more severely than the market to the fear about the consequences of  escalating tensions."
"In Europe and North America, two regions confronting Russia in the wake of Russia- Ukraine tensions, the net-of-market return approach revealed predominantly negative abnormal  returns in the ten days before the war. This demonstrates that investors hold a grim view of  bank stocks relative to the prior market's average performance. In other regions, except for two  "
"15    conflict escalation events that caused adverse market reactions on February 14 and 22, bank  stocks had outperformed average historical market benchmarks on many days. This indicates  that investor sentiment is more persistently affected in regions implementing significant  sanctions against Russia. The distinction between Europe and North America is that Europe is  significantly dependent on the Russian energy supply and engages in a wide range of banking  activities relating to Russia. A confrontation with Russia under these conditions might have  devastating effects on the European banking sector. The findings indicate that after removing  the market trend for ten straight days before the war, AAR in the European region was  overwhelmingly bearish. In North America, the AAR derived from the market model swung  between negative and positive values, showing that U.S. bank stocks largely followed the  market. In the ten days before the war, Asian bank stocks did not have many worse-performing  days than average market performance in the past, except for the market reaction on February  14 and 22. However, after excluding market movement, AAR has persistently negative values  for eight days before the war. This shows that Asian banks are more sensitive to the effects of  tensions between Russia and Ukraine than the entire stock market."
"Shortly after the official commencement of the war, the removal of Russia from the  SWIFT financial messaging system by the United States and Western nations caused a  temporary interruption of the worldwide payment system with Russia. This disruption could  impact the European banking sector as it becomes momentarily more difficult to get back the  loans in Russia. This sanction was implemented on Saturday, February 26. During the weekend  and market opening on Monday, several sanctions were implemented. The aggregated effect  of these sanctions was reflected in the markets on February 28. On this day, Europe, Asia,  North America, and Oceania all responded negatively to bank stocks. However, only Europe  and Oceania had negative and statistically significant AARs from the market model at 0.38%  (t-stat = 3.92) and 0.59% (t-stat = 2.27), respectively. This indicates that bank stocks in  "
"16    these two regions may be affected by the disruption in the payment system. However, the  0.38% decline in Europe is not as significant as the declines in prior days. This highlights the  market's sustained confidence in the soundness of the European banking system. On the 1st  and 2nd of March, all regions saw at least one day of negative AAR. The AAR of European  banks was negative at 0.98% on March 2 (t-stat = 10.84). Asian banking stocks also have a  negative AAR at 0.55% (t-stat = 5.29). These are the steepest price falls since the beginning  of the war. On the two days of March 1 and 2, the majority of the sanctions announced were  smaller than those introduced on the three days of February 26, 27, and 28. However, the  decrease in the first two days of March was more remarkable. This indicates that bank stocks  may not react directly to the sanctions."
"Before the war, bank stocks reacted severely on the days when the conflict escalated."
"However, if the market had sufficient time to think about the conflict's repercussions, the  continuous imposition of sanctions against Russia after the war might not heighten market  anxiety. Notably, the decline in the first two days of March coincided with the sharp rise in  energy prices. This association is comparable to when bank stocks dropped significantly around  the war event day. This finding suggests that bank stocks may be susceptible to swings in  energy prices, one of the most significant economic ramifications of the war. Figure 2 depicts  the daily change in AARs from 10 days before the war event to 10 days following. We also  plotted the yield on WTI oil front-month futures to proxy for the energy price change. AARs  tend to move in a very similar direction across the regions. This indicates that the war might  trigger a synchronized impact on global bank stocks. Before the day of the war, the opposite  movements could be observed between the AARs and the oil price, but this pattern was not  apparent. As soon as the war formally began, the movement of AARs in all regions became  strongly connected to oil price variations. When the price of oil rose sharply, bank stocks fell  "
17    significantly relative to the overall market level and vice versa. This result shows that energy  prices may significantly explain investors' expectations for bank stocks.
"[Insert Figure 2 about here]    The difference in the reaction of bank stocks before, during, and after the day of the  war reflects the difference in investor reaction patterns at different times. We find that these  results are well supported by the theory of response to anticipated realities introduced by  Laurin (2018). As mentioned, this war is not an unexpected event for investors. Hence, what is  the psychology of investors before the event occurs? Brickman (1978) suggests that, with  predictable events, people initially have little psychological belief that the event will happen."
"People will tend to limit their response even if the possible consequences are predictable,  especially when these consequences are unclear and the probability of the event occurring is  still low. Psychological studies mention this response pattern as ""status quo bias"" (Kahneman  et al., 1991). Laurin (2018) indicates that only when the event's probability increases, and the  events' consequences become more significant, psychological realism make people more  rational and promotes the response. This matches the market reaction when tensions between  Russia and Ukraine escalate and, therefore, sharply increases the probability of war. Laurin  (2018) also implies that when the event occurs, the feeling of the possibility of the event  becomes irrefutable. As a result, on the event day, people no longer delay their responses from  suspecting the occurrence and start to update their behavior following the rational expectation."
"After the event, people tend to react more rationally to updates on consequences. This explains  the market's reaction to the sharp oil price increase following the war."
"4.4 Reaction to the war event: short-term or persistent?  Table 5 presents the cumulative average abnormal return (CAARs) of bank stocks worldwide  and on six continents. The CAARs (10,1) worldwide from the market model and net-of- "
"18    market return are 1.11% (t-stat = 13.25) and 0.2% (t-stat=0.779), indicating that that bank  stocks in the ten days before the war did not significantly deviate from the market trend."
"Examining the performance trends of bank stocks across several areas reveals that they vary  by region. European and Asian bank stocks underperformed the historical and overall market  trends. South America and Oceania, meanwhile, outperformed both the historical market  average and the current market performance."
"[Insert Table 5 about here]  However, no matter how the bank stocks performed before the war, these stocks were still  heavily hit when the war began. After subtracting market trends, CAARs between the first day  of the war and the ten following days are negative for all regions. Statistically, this bearish  pattern is significant only in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America, indicating that  bank stocks had been severely affected only in these four regions by the war and sanctions."
"Observing the shift in CAAR when the time window is extended from 3 days to 5 days, 10  days, and 20 days after the war reveals the increasingly negative CAARs in Europe, Asia, and  North America. This result suggests that investor sentiment towards bank stocks in these three  areas worsened as the conflict continued. In contrast, according to the market model, South  America, Oceania, and Africa have insignificant CAAR(0,20), implying that the prolonged  conflict exerts no additional pressure on banking stock prices beyond the market movements  in these three locations."
5. Potential channels transferring the war impact to bank stocks' returns.
"In this section, we will explore the impact of two significant war consequences: (1) fluctuations  in energy prices due to sanctions aimed at Russia and (2) changes in currency values due to  disruptions in international trade and rising inflation. The price of energy has the potential to  alter banks' profit projections. First, increased energy prices will increase corporate expenses  "
"19    and fuel inflation. Inflation due to the supply side will likely lower consumption and increase  corporate risk. These impacts will diminish the loan demand and increase the credit risk for  banks. When inflation rises and international trade is hindered, imports and exports will be  harmed, influencing the exchange rate. Exchange rate risk is one of the major concerns for  banks, particularly those with active international banking operations. Since exchange rates are  often difficult to predict, the market may be more sensitive to these rate fluctuations caused by  the aftermath of this protracted war. The link between oil price fluctuations and stock prices is  well documented in the literature (Basher & Sadorsky, 2006; Ftiti et al., 2016; Kilian and Park,  2009; Ready, 2018). Ready (2018) shows that the stock market reacts differently to oil price  shocks from the supply and demand sides. Accordingly, demand-side shocks are positively  correlated with market returns, while supply-side shocks exert opposing effects. Jones and Kaul  (1996) also emphasize that world stock markets react more strongly to oil price shocks after  the war. This corresponds to the change in real future cash flows and the updates in expected  return. The literature also suggests the connection between stock prices and exchange rate  shocks (Dornbusch and Fischer, 1980; Phylaktis and Ravazzolo, 2005). This association also  becomes stronger at times of high market uncertainty, such as during periods of crisis  (Phylaktis and Ravazzolo, 2005)."
"We employ the front-month WTI oil price return to proxy for the change in energy prices and  the percentage change in exchange rates to reflect exchange rate risk. We use each country's  domestic currency for the U.S. dollar exchange rate. Accordingly, an increase in the exchange  rate implies an appreciation of the local currency relative to the U.S. dollar. For the U.S., we  use the U.S. Dollar Index to gauge the strength of the U.S. dollar. As a result, the percentage  change in the U.S. Dollar index will be used to replace the change in the exchange rate for the  case of the U.S. To assess the sensitivity of bank stocks to energy prices and exchange rates,  we regress bank stock returns on the oil return and percentage change in exchange rates. We  "
"20    include a post-war dummy variable to examine the overall decrease of bank stocks after the  war and the interaction of this post-war dummy variable with oil return and the percentage  change in the exchange rate to analyze the update in investor expectations after the war. The  specific regression equation is as follows:  ,= + 1. + 2. _+ 1. _+ 2. _. _ + 1. _+ 2. _. _+ 1. _ + 2. _. _+ () +                         (5)  where   is the war event dummy taking the value of 1 on February 24; _ is the  dummy variable taking the value of 1 after February 24. _ is the return of the  benchmark dedicated for each market. _ and _ are the return of the  front-month WTI oil futures and the percentage change in the exchange rate corresponding to  each market, respectively. In this function, we use a set of control variables. First, we control  for the country-fixed, year-fixed and day-of-week fixed effects. Second, we add the covid19  sensitivity of each market to filter out the impact of the covid19 pandemic on bank stocks. To  measure this variable, we employ the dynamic linear model to regress the market return on the  number of new covid-case reported for the previous day in each country. By this method, we  get each market's time-varying coefficient of new covid cases. This time-varying load help  capture better how the market responded to the covid situation at different times. We run the  regression for the period from January 2020 to April 2022."
"Table 6 presents the regression results for the whole world and each region. For each area, we  report the results of three regression models. Model (3) contains all variables represented in  Equation (5). Model (1) substitutes the post-war dummy variable with the dummy for the  "
"21    second trading day. Neither Model (1) nor Model (2) contain interaction variables. Model (1)  in Table 6 shows that the impact of the war event is comparable to the AARs reported in Table  2, with negative coefficients of the war dummy for all regions. The only region where this  effect was not statistically significant was Oceania."
"Similar to Table 2's findings, Europe was the most affected region on the first day of the war."
"Model (1) supports the results in Table 4 that Europe is the only region witnessing the  overreaction of bank stocks when controlling for market movement. In Europe, the coefficient  of the dummy variable for the second trading day is 0.733% (t-stat = 8.06). Looking at the  results in Models (2) and (3), overall bank stock returns worldwide were about 0.13% lower  after the war. Only Europe, Asia, and North America were the regions where the decline in  banking stock returns was statistically significant after the war. Asia experienced the greatest  fall of the three regions, 0.13% (t-stat = 3.70). Europe and North America suffered average  drops of approximately 0.1%. The post-war dummy is not statistically significant in South  America, Oceania, and Africa. This result implies that the war's outcome only changed the  average expectations of bank stock returns in Europe, Asia, and North America. Examining the  coefficient of the interaction variable between market returns and stock returns reveals that  bank stocks in Asia, North America, and Africa are less correlated with the market after the  war. Next, we will discuss the potential impacts of energy prices and exchange rates on bank  stocks after the war."
"[Insert Table 6 about here]  5.1. Energy price  Model (3) in Table 6 shows that banking stocks worldwide generally react negatively to oil  return; the coefficient of oil return before the war is around 0.001 (t-stat = 3.68). However,  this negative response level is not uniform across all regions. Europe, Asia, North America,  "
"22    and Oceania were regions that responded favorably to rising oil prices before the war. A 1%  increase in oil return corresponds to a bank stock increase of approximately 0.002% in Europe,  0.005% in Asia, 0.004% in North America, and 0.016% in Oceania. This reaction of bank  stocks is not neglectable because the oil price tends to swing much more than the stock prices."
"In contrast, South America and Africa respond negatively to an increase in oil return. Europe,  Asia, North America, and Oceania are regions where developed countries and large developing  economies are concentrated. Therefore, the market's reaction might greatly influence the  economy's outlook. In this analysis, we use the sample from January 2020, the same time as  the pandemic's onset. In 2020, travel restrictions and lockdowns caused demand for energy to  plummet, leading to a sharp drop in oil prices. Since the distribution of the covid vaccine  started, these restrictions were also relaxed; businesses gradually returned to normal operations,  boosting oil demand and prices. Before the war, when the covid crisis still influenced investor  sentiment, rising oil prices indicated an economic recovery. This is beneficial for banks. Our  result is consistent with Ready (2018) that oil price change induced from the demand side  positively correlates with stock market performance."
"However, since the war began, the increase in oil prices has not reflected the market's recovery  but rather the war and sanctions. High oil prices raise prices in most countries and drive  inflation. In the context of high inflation in most nations, a further rise in inflation will  exacerbate financial instability and directly impact banks' outlook. Except for Africa, which  has responded negatively to rising oil prices since before the war, other regions have  experienced a substantial shift in the reaction of bank stocks to oil return since the beginning  of the war. The coefficients of the interaction variable between the oil return and the post-war  dummy are all negative and statistically significant in Europe, Asia, North America, and  Oceania. Notably, this negative coefficient is several times more than the positive association  "
"23    before the war. This result indicates that, since the day of the war, all positive association  between oil return and bank stock returns has been fully reversed. Furthermore, the substantial  correction in the reaction of bank stocks to oil return suggests that this war has made bank  stocks highly sensitive to swings in energy prices. This pattern is in line with the literature on  oil price supply shock negatively impacting the stock markets (Kilian & Park, 2009; Ready,  2018)."
"5.2. Exchange rate  When examining the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on bank stocks, the results in Table 6  reveal different patterns across continents. Only Europe and Asia have statistically significant  correlations between stock returns and exchange rate changes among the regions reported."
"There is no evidence supporting bank stocks' response to exchange rate changes before the war  in other areas. After the war, however, bank stocks had a different relationship with the  exchange rate, as shown by the regression results. The findings indicate that bank stocks  worldwide became more susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates following the conflict."
The coefficient of the interaction variable at 0.485 (t-stat = 40.53) implies that a faster decrease  in the value of the domestic currency will reflect negatively on the bank stocks' performance.
"This pattern is observed for most continents, with statistically significant adjustments in  Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa. This result also implies that, since the war, bank  stocks have become more sensitive to exchange rate changes. In other words, the war tends to  increase the relevance of exchange rate risk for the outlook banking sector. Our finding  highlights the importance of managing exchange rate risk in the banking system, adding to the  literature on foreign exchange rate impacts on bank stocks (Choi et al., 1992; Wetmore & Brick,  1994; Chamberlain et al., 1997; Martin & Mauer, 2003). As the literature has documented the  direct effect of exchange rate on expected future cash flows of banks via the change in  "
"24    international assets and liabilities, international service fees, and off-balance sheet activities  (Martin & Meuer, 2003), and the indirect effects via the impacted cash flows of banks'  customers and fund providers (Chamberlain et al., 1997; Martin & Meuer, 2003), the exchange  rate is not only a story dedicated to banks engaging in international banking activities but also  for all other domestic banks. Our finding implies that no conner in the banking system might  be immune from exchange rate shocks caused by international adverse events."
6. Conclusion  Our research investigates the impact of the Russian and Ukrainian wars on global bank stocks.
"Using data from 2,341 commercial banks in 91 countries, we show that bank stocks globally  fell by an average of 1.5% on the first day of the war. Europe is the most affected region,  experiencing a decline of around 4%. This result suggests the extreme sensitivity of the  European banking sector to the expected repercussions of the war. Additionally, our event  study reveals that the war significantly influenced the bank's shares, with the decline being  considerably more profound than the average stock market movement. Since banking is the  sector that ensures the financial system's stability, the reaction of bank stocks indicates the  market's expectation regarding the risk of bank stocks, consequently indicating the stability of  the entire financial market. Further, the war between Russia and Ukraine could also serve as a  stress test for the global banking system. According to our findings, Europe, Asia, and North  America are the most susceptible to shocks from an international adverse event."
"The reaction pattern of bank stocks before, during, and after the war also revealed the behavior  and expectations of investors towards war-related developments. Before the war, we found that  bank stocks reacted aggressively only when the likelihood of war soared. This reflects the  psychological nature of investors against anticipated events. Before the war, investors tended  to delay their responses based on their expectations. As a result, investors reacted forcefully on  "
"25    the day of the war to correct the price, as expected by the market. The response of investors  following the war also demonstrates the markets' rational adjustments to the observable  consequences of the war and related sanctions. From the behavioral finance perspective, our  research also shows that investors overreact to associated events in the most affected areas,  adding to the rational responses to the expected impacts of the war. This implies that adverse  events also trigger market participants' behavioral biases."
"Our research has several implications for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers when  designing effective financial strategies by showing the close relationship between war,  geopolitical risk, the banking sector, the energy sector and the stability of the whole financial  system. First, Ukraine  Russia war has a significant implication for oil prices and exchange  rates during the uncertain period, especially in the long term. As discussed above, we find that  fluctuations in energy prices and exchange rates are two serious consequences of the war that  could significantly impact market expectations for bank stocks, a proxy for the perceived  soundness of the financial system. The findings reveal that since the beginning of the war, bank  stocks have been highly susceptible to oil supply shocks that worsen inflation or exchange rate  risks. This vulnerability could substantially impact the effectiveness of macroeconomic  policies designed to curb inflation and stabilize financial markets. Observing the market's  reaction to the war's consequences might be instructive for the financial system's risk  management. Second, this paper also highlights the effect of oil-dependent of European  countries on Russia during the uncertain time, addressing a need for less the EU's dependence  on imported fossil fuels and more actions for affordable, secure energy. Third, the Ukraine- Russia war and its related sanctions also point out the need to consider business cycle  implications of political disruptions and the possible damage to trade relationships between  countries in general and banks in particular."
26    This study only considers investors' expectations of the banking system around the war event.
"The reaction of bank stocks to the war could imply public confidence in the banking system,  which is an important factor in systemic risk management. Further research might continue to  investigate the direct impact of the war and its consequences on the profitability and risk of  banks using accounting data.

32    Figures    Figure 1: Bank stock returns movement around the world since 2020  This graph depicts bank stock returnsmovements from January 2020 to April 2022 for six continents and the  whole world. The blue line represents banks' average daily returns. The red line presents the movement of the  long-term trend in the graph. We employ the HodrickPrescott filter to separate the long-term trend of stock  returns from the short-term noise.
33      Figure 2: Oil returns and Average abnormal returns of bank stocks around the war.
This figure illustrates the association between the movement of crude oil return and the abnormal returns of bank  stocks in six regions from 10 days before the war event to 10 days following. The graph above reflects the  movement of oil return calculated for the WTI front month crude oil contract. The graph below shows the  movement of average abnormal returns in bank stocks for six continents. The abnormal return in this graph is  calculated from the market model.

35    Table 2: Average abnormal return of bank stocks worldwide and for each continent on the war event day.
"This table reports the average abnormal returns of bank stocks on the first day of the war. We measure the abnormal returns in two approaches. Panel A shows  abnormal returns from the market model, while Panel B displays the abnormal returns from the net-of-market return approach. For the whole world and each region,  we test whether the corresponding average abnormal return is significant from 0. *, **, and *** indicate the significance level as 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively."
"This analysis covers six continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America, and the whole world."
"The expected returns from market model approach is calculated by regressing each actual stock return series on the corresponding market return. To prevent the  confounding effect of the covid19 pandemic fear and vaccine distribution event at the end of 2020, we restrict our sample to start from March 2021. Specifically,  the market model is estimated from 230 days to 11 days before the war. Based on the estimated result, the abnormal return of each stock is measured as follows:  , (1) = .( +  . ,), where . is the actual return of stock i and , is the corresponding market return on the day t.   and   are the coefficients  estimated from the market model."
"The market model measures the abnormal returns as the difference between actual return against the average historical market return (Brown & Warner, 1985). To  account for the potential weekday effect, we measure the abnormal return of a stock as the difference between the actual stock return and the average corresponding  historical market return on the same weekday. Specifically, we calculate the following specification:  , (2) = . , same weekday between T11 and T230."

"43    Table 6: Returns of bank stocks and the association with oil price, exchange rate, and market return movement  This table presents the regression results of bank stock returns against the war-related times and periods. We perform three regression models for the whole world  and for each region. In model (1), we use two dummy variables representing the first and second trading days following the war event to test the market reaction  in these two days. To better capture the effect of the war event on bank stock returns, we control for the effect of market returns, market sensitivity to covid daily  new cases, oil return, and exchange rate changes. This model controls for country-fixed effects, time-fixed effects and market-fixed effects. In model (2), we replace  the second trading day dummy with a dummy representing the post-war period. We also use the same independent and control variables as in model (1). To further  examine the difference in the correlation between bank stock returns and market return, oil return, and exchange rate changes after the war, we estimate model (3)  as the model (2), adding the interaction between the dummy variable after the war and each of the test variables above. *, **, and *** indicate the significance  level as 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively."
