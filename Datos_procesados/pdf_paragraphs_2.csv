The Russian-Ukrainian war is having a dramatic impact on the environment. The effects are still unknown."
"However, it is expected that the effects will be substantial. Since the conflict is ongoing, it is challenging to have 
ground-accurate data that could show an idea of the extension of the impact. Remote sensing can support a 
preliminary analysis in areas without safety to conduct fieldwork. This work aims to assess the impacts of the 
Russian-Ukrainian war on the environment using field and remote sensing sources. This is the first work that 
published fieldwork data from this conflict. Different soil properties were studied (e.g., texture and heavy metals) 
in different places (Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan). Remote sensing (e.g., Normalised Difference Vegetation 
Index) at different spatial scales (Eastern Ukraine and case study in the Kharkiv region) were assessed between 
2021 and 2022. The results showed that the finer sediments increased in bombed areas compared with not 
bombed ones. Also, there was an increase in the content of heavy metals (e.g., Manganese, Iron, Cobalt, Copper, 
Cadmium, Chromium, Lead and Nickel) in soils in the shelled areas, compared to the non-shelled. This was

mainly observed in the Novy Korotych site. Remote sensing analysis revealed that between 2021 and 2022 at a 
large scale (Eastern and southeastern Ukraine), vegetation greenness decreased in the areas where the combats 
are more intense (Luhansk and Donetsk) and increased in the southern area (Zaporizhia and Kherson), likely due 
to agriculture abandonment. On a small scale (case study in Kharkiv region), the vegetation greenness was 
affected due to the bombing. Although our results are preliminary, it is important to highlight that shelling is 
increasing soil pollution and contributing to vegetation greenness reduction where the fighting is intense. The 
actual impacts of the war still need to be understood entirely."
"1. Introduction 
The Russian-Ukrainian war dramatically impacts society and the 
economy, including life losses, mental health, collective memory, 
infrastructure disruption (e.g., housing, health, schools), refugees, and 
economic breakdown (e.g., hand labour mobilisation to war; food se­
curity). These effects can last for many generations, compromising the 
future aspirations of the countries involved and, ultimately, the global 
stability and the relation among nations (Pereira et al., 2022a, 2022b; 
United Nations, 2022a). Although the impacts on society and the 
economy are dramatic, the effects of war on the environment cannot be 
overlooked. The effects are paradoxical. From one side, war-affected 
areas can be depopulated due to the risk of life loss, reducing the 
human pressure (e.g., agriculture and industrial activities) on the envi­
ronment and vegetation and biodiversity recuperation. Examples of this 
dynamic were observed in Afghanistan (Zhang et al., 2023), Korean 
Demilitarized Zone (Lawrence et al., 2015) and Cyprus dead zone 
(Constantinou et al., 2020). On another side, the effects of bombing 
contribute to landscape morphology change (e.g., bombturbation, 
trenches and tunnels construction, heavy machinery circulation) (Cer­
tini et al., 2013), pedogenesis (Hupy and Schaetzl, 2006), soil air and 
water pollution (e.g., traffic circulation, shelling) (Pereira et al., 2020), 
vegetation degradation (e.g., trenches construction, heavy machinery 
circulation, wildfires, (e.g., Omar et al., 2005), and biodiversity and 
habitat loss (e.g., clear cuts, pollution, wild animals hunting) in terres­
trial and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., Hanson, 2018). These impacts can last 
long, depending on the wartime and conflict intensity. Overall, the 
adverse effects are always high than the benefits (Hanson, 2018). For 
instance, shelling, mines and trench construction destroy or remix soil 
horizons (Pereira et al., 2020). Heavy machinery circulation and 
bombing destroy soil cover and increase compaction, erosion and 
pollution (e.g., Abdo, 2018). Previous works observed that in areas 
affected by war, soil texture changes, there is an increase of trace 
metals/radioactive elements/oil products/energetic materials/nitro­
aromatic explosives/organophosphorus nerve agents and a reduction of 
macro and microbiological activity, water infiltration, organic matter 
and key nutrients (e.g., carbon and nitrogen) (e.g., Al-Awadhi and 
Misak, 2005; Broomandi et al., 2020; Freije, 2015). Vegetation loss is 
affected directly by the shelling, grenades or mines, and wildfires pro­
duced by these explosions. Clear cuts imposed by warfare activities and 
heavy machinery passage reduce vegetation cover (e.g., Robinson and 
Sutherland, 2002; Nackoney et al., 2014; Katayama et al., 2015). All 
these impacts conduce to a dramatic reduction of habitats and the 
biodiversity of the affected areas. In addition, in war zones, wildlife 
hunting increases (e.g., Gaynor et al., 2016)."
"Remote sensing techniques (Witmar, 2015) are crucial to assessing 
environmental conditions in large-scale areas and when accessibility is 
limited, as in the case of war. They are essential to understand the 
spatiotemporal impacts of the conflict and when the intensity (e.g., 
selling is more intense) or where there is a vegetation recuperation due 
to land abandonment (e.g., Zhang et al., 2023). Remote sensing-based 
studies have been applied to assess the impact of armed conflicts in 
Afghanistan (Beck, 2003; Zhang et al., 2023), Syria (Lubin and Saleem, 
2019), Kuwait (Ajmi and Din, 2009), Iraque (Jahjah et al., 2007), Sierra 
Leone (Gbanie et al., 2018), Bosnia (Witmer, 2008), South Sudan 
(Mackenhauer Olsen et al., 2021), Liberia (Enaruvbe et al., 2019), 
Mynamar (Shwesin Aung, 2021), Colombia (Camargo et al., 2020), 
second world war (Poland) (Waga and Fajer, 2021) at different scales, e."
"g., local (Lubin and Saleem, 2019) and National (Zhang et al., 2023). In 
Ukraine, only one work was developed, but it was very local and did not 
assess the impacts at a large scale, especially in the areas where the 
intensity of the combats is the highest. Also, no spectral indices were 
conducted, and the impacts were not quantified. The work was con­
ducted immediately after the war (Shevchuck et al., 2022)."
The ongoing war in Ukraine is a dramatic event for global security.
"Their impacts are global, and several reports highlight their impacts on 
food security (FAO, 2022), poverty (UNICEF, 2022), inflation (Guenette 
et al., 2022), energy prices (United Nations, 2022b), global trade 
(UNCTAD, 2022), human rights (United Nations Human Rights, 2022), 
inequality, education (United Nations, 2022b) unemployment (Inter­
national Labour Organization, 2022), health, gender equality (United 
Nations, 2022c), cultural heritage (European Parliament, 2023) political 
relations,1 population displacement (UNICEF, 2023), population 
vulnerability to natural disasters (Pereira et al., 2022a), global agendas 
(e.g., sustainable development goals) (Pereira et al., 2022b), global 
governance2 and the environment (Pereira et al., 2022a). The environ­
ment is one of the most affected. The war negatively affects the envi­
ronment, including air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, 
biodiversity, soil and landscape morphology, and water availability and 
quality. This ultimately will reduce the capacities of the ecosystems to 
supply ecosystem services in quantity and quality (Pereira et al., 2022a)."
"Although the Russian-Ukrainian war is an ongoing conflict, and we do 
not have the dimension of the full impacts of this conflict, it is important 
to understand the effects on the environment, which to some extent, are 
not completely assessed (Pereira et al., 2022a). The difficulty of going to 
the field and in war-affected areas increases the challenge of obtaining 
field-based data and better understanding the impacts of shelling on the 
environment. For instance, most of the works during ongoing conflicts 
were conducted using remote sensing techniques, such as in Syria (e.g., 
Abdo, 2018; Daiyoub et al., 2023), Mynamar (Shwesin Aung, 2021) and 
South Sudan (Olsen et al., 2021). However, more information about 
field evidence in ongoing conflicts must be available. Although this is a 
challenging step, it is important to know it. From field surveys, obtaining 
more accurate and reliable data and the true content of a determined 
parameter (e.g., soil texture, pollutant concentration) is possible. Using 
remote sensing techniques, we can only estimate indicators based on 
surface reflectance information from individual bands' reflectance and/ 
or the different band combinations (e.g., spectral indexes). Therefore, 
although more local, field surveys provide more accurate data than 
remote sensing techniques. This work presents field-based data on this 
conflict for the first time. To better understand the effects of the war on 
the environment, remote sensing analyses were conducted at different 
scales. This pilot study aims to assess the impacts of shelling on a few soil 
properties (e.g., texture and heavy metals) and vegetation cover (Nor­
malised Difference Vegetation Index -NDVI) in the first year after the 
war."

2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Study area, experimental design and laboratory analysis 
Soils were sampled in two different areas near Kharkiv, and remote 
sensing analyses were conducted in eastern and southeast parts of 
Ukraine (Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia and Kherson) and 
Dolyna Slovyansky District (hereafter case study) (Fig. 1). The average 
annual temperature (1981–2010) of the study areas varies from 8 ◦C 
(Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk) to 9 ◦C (Zaporizhia) and 10 ◦C (Kher­
son). The average annual precipitation (1981–2010) oscillates between 
140 and 150 mm (Kharkiv), to 130–120 mm (Luhansk and Donetsk) and 
110–120 mm (Zaporizhia and Kherson) (Balabukh and Malytska, 2017)."
"Soil sampling areas (Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan) were located in 
cropland areas (Fig. 1). According to WRB (2014), the soils were clas­
sified as chernozems. In Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan, samples were 
collected (April 14–15, 2022) in a control area (50 m from the crater) 
with the same land use. In both study sites, bomb craters were identified 
visually. Inside the crater (Novy Korotych), samples were collected at 
different positions, bottom of the crater, wall of the crater and top of the 
crater. In each position, 3 subsamples were collected and mixed to form 
a composite sample. The mixed sample was packed and labelled for 
laboratory analysis. In Mala Rohan, only one sample was taken inside 
the bottom of the crater. Here the field procedures for sampling were the 
same as in Novy Korotych. Samples were transported to the laboratory 
and dried in an oven at a temperature of 35 ◦C for 24 h. Subsequently, 
samples were sieved (2 mm mesh) and separated into two fractions, one 
for texture other for chemical analysis. The size of soil particles was 
determined using the laser diffraction method on a Mastersizer 3000E 
particle analyser from Malvern Instruments with a HydroEV liquid 
dispersion module. Carbonates were removed using hydrochloric acid 
with a molar concentration of 0.2 and 0.05 mol/dm3, and disaggrega­
tion was done using a sodium hydroxide solution with a molar con­
centration of 1 mol/dm3. Based on these parameters, the Mastersizer 
3000E will measure the particle size distribution of the soil sample by 
passing a laser beam through the sample dispersed in water and 
measuring the diffraction pattern of the scattered light. The Mit theory 
was used to calculate the particle size distribution from the diffraction

pattern, considering the particles' refractive index and absorption coef­
ficient. The determination of mobile forms of Manganese (Mn), Zinc 
(Zn), Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium 
(Cr), Lead (Pb) and Nickel (Ni) in soil samples was determined in a 
buffered ammonium-acetate extract with a pH of 4.8 to ensure accuracy 
and reliability of measurement results by atomic absorption spectro­
photometry on the device SATURN - 4."
"2.2. Data, spatial and statistical analysis 
Landsat 8 imagery (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/) with a resolu­
tion of 30 m (Eastern and southeast Ukraine) and PlanetScope imagery 
with 3 m resolution (case study) (Planet Team, 2023) were used for 
remote sensing analysis. Normalised Difference Vegetation Index 
(NDVI) was used to assess vegetation cover (Jiang et al., 2021), and it 
was calculated in the Google Earth Engine platform (https://eart 
hengine.google.com/). This index was used to assess the impact of the 
war on vegetation greenness. NDVI was calculated using the Near 
Infrared (NIR) and Red (R) bands based on the formula: 
(NIR −Red)
(NIR + Red)
The process in Google Earth Engine encompassed (1) filtering the 
dates to cover the month of June 2021 and 2022 for the eastern and 
southeast parts of Ukraine Images from 25 to 06-2021/29-06-2022 were 
used for the case study; (2) selecting a single harmonised surface 
reflection image; (3) export the image as a raster; (4) import into ArcGIS 
Pro (ESRI, 2022) for spatial analysis and mapping."
"2.3. Statistical analysis 
For statistical analysis, a fishnet (1 km resolution for eastern Ukraine 
and 10 m resolution for the case study) was conducted using the ArcGIS 
Pro fishnet tool. Data was collected from the rasters data set (2021 and 
2022) using the ArcGIS Pro extract multivalues to point tool. Significant 
differences between NDVI values between 2021 and 2022 (eastern 
Ukraine and case study) were conducted with a non-parametric Wil­
coxon rank test, and significant differences were considered at a p <
0.05. Statistical analysis was carried out using JASP (https://jasp-stats."
org/).
"3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Soil texture and heavy metals 
The results showed that in Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan, the % of 
2–0.5 mm particles was lower in the bombed area than in the control."
"The same was observed in Mala Rohan (Table 1). The explosion imposed 
by shelling may have increased the % of soil fine sediments due to 
particle slaking. Bomb explosions detach and redistribute large amounts 
of soil. It is well known that bombs substantially affect soil physical 
degradation (Poesen, 2018), as can be observed in Fig. S1. Table 2 shows 
the metal content in Novy Korotych and Mala Rohan. In Novy Korotych, 
except for Zn, all the other metals were higher in the bombed areas than 
in control. Concerning Mala Rohan, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb were 
higher in the shelled area compared to the control. In Fig. S1 (taking as 
an example Lysychansk), region), it is visible in some areas, a high 
density of craters created by bombs. Therefore, it is likely that the im­
pacts of shelling in these areas on soil physical and chemical degradation 
are high. Bomb explosions increase dramatically the presence of metals 
in soil, as highlighted in different works (e.g., Certini et al., 2013; 
Broomandi et al., 2020; Pereira et al., 2020) due to the substances 
released. Previous reports highlighted high contamination in soils 
affected by war activities in different areas of the world. For instance, 
Hussain and Gondal (2008), found that in soils exposed to military ac­
tivities in the Gulf War (1991)- Saudi Arabia -, the levels of Cr and Fe 
increased substantially. Similar results were identified by Sadiq et al."
"(1992) in Kuwait, where Cd, Co, Cr, Cu and Ni levels were very high in 
soils affected by military activities (e.g., oil fires) and in areas affected 
by military activities during WWI (Pas-de-Calais, France), Williams and 
Rintoul-Hynes (2022) observed that some areas were enriched with Cu 
and Pb. Meerschman et al. (2011) also identified Ypres war zone 
(Belgium) (WWI), that several areas had a high concentration of Cu and 
Pb due to warfare activities. Thestorf and Makki (2022) found that in 
Berlin (Germany), soils and war debris from WWII were enriched in Cd, 
Cu, Ni, Pb and Fe."
"3.2. Remote sensing analysis 
Table 3 shows the NDVI results for the Ukraine eastern and south­
eastern and case study for 2021 and 2022. The results showed that in the 
first area, the NDVI values were significantly higher in 2022 than in 
2021, while in the case study area, the opposite was observed. Figs. 2 
and 3 show the NDVI spatial distribution in both areas. In Ukraine's 
eastern and southeastern areas, analysing images with 30 m resolution, 
we did not identify a clear spatial pattern in the Kharkiv region. In the 
southern area (Zaporizhia and Kherson), in 2022, several areas were 
greener than in 2021. In Kherson, there were examples of land aban­
donment (Fig. S3). This may be attributed to migration and the aban­
donment of agricultural activities in the country's southeastern part 
(Zaporizhia and Kherson). Another hypothesis is that this could be due 
to crop rotation, which can occur in some instances. This possibility is 
not excluded. However, there were shreds of evidence of land aban­
donment in the cases we spotted, for example, in point 7 of Fig. S3. In 
Fig. S4, it is visible from the land use history that the area was inten­
sively used for agriculture from 2014 until 2021. In 2022 after the war 
started, it was observed that there was no soil tillage to plant crops."
"There is evidence of spontaneous vegetation growth when soil should be 
prepared for crop plantation, thus, evidence of agriculture abandonment 
(e.g., Baeten et al., 2010; Khorchani et al., 2020; Fig. S3). The war 
provoked a massive population movement in Ukraine. It is estimated 
that 7 million people went abroad and 5.3 million are displaced inter­
nally.3 A recent report showed that several households reduced or 
ceased4 agricultural practices. Previous works observed that in war- 
affected areas, land abandonment increased vegetation development 
(e.g., Zhang et al., 2023). This was observed in other areas affected by 
wars, such as in Vietnam (Lacombe et al., 2010), Chechen wars (Yin 
et al., 2019), Bosnia (Witmer, 2008), Croatia (Mikulic et al., 2014), Syria 
(Hazaymeh et al., 2022), Nicaragua (Stevens et al., 2011) and Poland 
(WWII) (Latocha et al., 2016). In Luhansk and Donetsk, a decrease was 
identified. For instance, the comparison between satellite images from 
2021 and 2022 showed that greening areas decreased (Fig. 2). This was 
attributed to vegetation degradation caused by wildfires due to shelling 
(Fig. S3). At a large-scale analysis (Ukraine's eastern and southeastern),

we observed that greening decreased in some areas while others 
increased. For instance, war has been more intense in Luhansk and 
Donetsk, and the shelling is highly dense, as shown in Fig. S2. This 
contributes to explaining the vegetation greenness decrease in these 
areas. In the case study, we found a similar situation. Shelling and 
bombing substantially degraded forested and agricultural areas (Fig. 3)."
"Previous works observed that vegetation and biodiversity are severely 
affected in places where war activities are intense (e.g., Lawrence et al., 
2015; Kanyamibwa, 1998; Hanson, 2018; Pereira et al., 2022a,Pereira 
et al., 2022b). This was easier to identify in the case study due to the fine 
resolution of the images obtained (3 m) (Fig. 4). It was possible to 
identify the bomb's impacts on vegetation. The negative impacts of 
armed conflicts on vegetation were also identified in other places such as 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Nackoney et al., 2014), Vietnam 
(Lacombe et al., 2010), Cambodia (Kiernan, 2010), the Czech Republic 
(WWII) (Dolejˇ
s et al., 2020), Syria (Almohamad, 2020) and Iraq (Aliyas, 
2016)."
"3.3. Limitations and uncertainties 
The soil data described in this work will likely be the first from this 
war. We acknowledge that it might not represent the area, and the 
number of samples is minimal, giving an incomplete picture of the im­
pacts of bombturbation on soil texture and metals. Detailed studies are 
needed. However, the results showed that the impacts are similar to 
those observed in other war zones. This is an ongoing conflict, and it is 
highly challenging and risky to go to the field. It is unpredictable the 
areas that will be bombed. Therefore, it is extremely risky to go to the 
field. However, it is crucial to have access to the areas where the com­
bats are more intense and sample soils, vegetation and water to have a 
concrete picture of the impacts of the war on the environment. Also, the 
effects after the war finish can be high than what we observe now, 
making our results limited and uncertain to some extent. There are 
several limitations regarding the large-scale assessment, mainly because 
the resolution is coarse and lacks detail. For instance, it is difficult to 
identify the impacts of bombs on vegetation and soils. In our work, at a 
large scale, we identified vegetation greenness in the southern part of 
Ukraine. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis at a finer resolution showed 
that bombs substantially impacted the vegetation and soils."

3.4. Implications for management 
The impacts of this war on the environment are largely uncertain."
"However, they are expected to be substantial (Pereira et al., 2022a), and 
it is expected to be a “toxic legacy”5 of this event. According to the 
OECD6 “The war has caused widespread and severe damage to the envi­
ronment and inflicted both immediate and longer-term consequences on the 
human health, ecosystems and the Ukrainian economy and beyond.”. It is 
challenging to estimate these impacts. Nevertheless, it is key to assess 
them once the war ends. Another impact that needs to be considered is 
the long-term impact of war on the environment. Several works high­
lighted that wars have long-term impacts on soil, water, air and biodi­
versity (e.g., Bardgett, 2016; Schillinger et al., 2020; Rawtani et al., 
2022). For instance, increasing heavy metals in the bombed areas 
observed in this work can contribute to soil, water and biodiversity 
degradation. This can increase land degradation and be reflected ulti­
mately in society (e.g., human health) and the economy (land produc­
tivity). Land degradation provoked by war can have numerous negative 
implications on regulation (e.g., air and water purification, noise regu­
lation, climate regulation, flood regulation, carbon sequestration, 
pollination), provisioning (e.g., food production, medicinal plants, 
biomass) and cultural (e.g., recreation, landscape aesthetics, cultural 
heritage, social cohesion) (Pereira et al., 2022). Several concerns have 
been raised about the impacts of this war on global food security (Eu­
ropean Parliament, 2022; FAO, 2022; Lin et al., 2023). This can be 
accentuated if the ecosystems are damaged. This needs to be considered 
as well. Another important aspect is the negative impacts on cultural 
heritage that are ongoing due to shelling. The impacts of war on climate 
change (e.g., greenhouse emissions) and how climate change events (e."
"g., floods or droughts) will affect an area environmentally, socially and 
economically damaged must also be understood. Understanding that 
these effects can occur and preventing them will be key to improving 
post-war management. Several works highlighted that the impacts of 
climate change could be severe (e.g. Kireitseva et al., 2023). Neverthe­
less, it is also true that the war triggered a transition to the use of cleaner 
energy (e.g., Nerlinger and Utz, 2022). Another important aspect is that 
this conflict hampered important global goals such as the Sustainable 
Development Goals. COVID−19 affected the capacity of several coun­
tries (e.g., mainly from the global south) to meet the proposed targets?."
"The war accentuated these difficulties. Some reports7 highlighted that 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in 2030 is extremely 
challenging (Pereira et al., 2022b; UNDP, 2022). Overall, there is a need 
for large-scale environmental restoration in Ukraine after the war. It is 
unpredictable the damage extension. The necessity of the establishment 
of a well-coordinated plan of environmental restoration has been high­
lighted by different institutions such as World Wildlife Foundation,8 
United Nations,9 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop­
ment.10 Although preliminary, the results obtained in this work support 
the idea that there is a need for a major restoration strategy in Ukraine 
after the war."
"4. Conclusions 
Under the current conditions, it is challenging to collect data in the 
field and have a comprehensive idea about the impacts of the Russian- 
Ukrainian war on the environment. Remote sensing techniques can be 
a solution to understanding the effects. This is the first work that pub­
lishes data about the impacts of the war on soil properties. The impacts 
of the bombing on the soils of the studied area are evident. For instance, 
the % of fine sediments and most heavy metals increased. Remote 
sensing analysis at a larger scale revealed that between 2021 and 2022, 
greening areas decreased in the areas where the combats are more 
intense (Luhansk and Donetsk), while in other areas located in south­
eastern Ukraine (Zaporizhia and Kherson), increased due to agriculture 
practices abandonment. Population migration affected vegetation dy­
namics. At small scales analysis, it was observed that the vegetation was 
damaged due to the shelling. Further works need to be conducted on the 
field to understand the impacts of the war on soil, water and biodiver­
sity. Studies focused on remote sensing analysis must be assessed at 
different scales and with a large temporal spectrum."
