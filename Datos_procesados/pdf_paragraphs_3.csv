History suggests that the Russo-Ukrainian war could prove to be a prolonged conflict. It has already disrupted 
supply chains of basic necessities such as wheat and energy and changed the global business landscape. In 
particular, B2B firms are learning to improvise and devise new sourcing strategies. Many manufacturers are 
working on diversifying their approach to sourcing and developing new offerings with alternative ingredients/ 
components or energy sources. In this article, the authors discuss eight consequences of a prolonged conflict and 
discuss their implications on B2B markets and supply chains."
"1. Introduction 
Despite the size and importance of B2B marketing, there have been 
ongoing concerns regarding a consistent lack of scholarly attention to it 
(Danneels & Lilien, 1998; Malhotra & Uslay, 2009; LaPlaca & Katrichis, 
2009; Lilien, 2016; Mora Cortez & Johnston, 2017; Webster 1978). This 
is especially problematic since B2C pipelines rely on the vigor of B2B 
marketing activities; a vast majority of businesses are not vertically in­
tegrated. Buyer behavior, as well as impactful B2B marketing, depends 
heavily on the context (Sheth, 2011; Sheth et al., 2022b). There are few 
laws and lawlike generalizations in marketing that can transcend con­
texts (Sheth & Sisodia, 1999). Thus, contingency theory (Chandler, 
1962; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967a, 1967b; Ruekert, Walker, & Roering, 
1985; Woodward, 1965; Zeithaml, Varadarajan, & Zeithaml, 1988) 
which suggests that the optimal way to organize, operate or manage an 
organization depends on the internal and external factors, is uniquely 
applicable to B2B relationships. The current study complements the 
extant B2B marketing research efforts using contingency theory (e.g., 
Chung et al., 2021; Gnizy & Shoham, 2018; Hughes et al., 2020; Tang­
pong, Hung, & Li, 2019) with its macro perspective and focus on the 
black swan event—the Russo-Ukrainian war."
"There are currently at least five primary external drivers that shape 
B2B markets and relationships. Not surprisingly, the first macro driver is 
technology. Enterprise resource planning and customer relationship 
platforms such as SAP and Salesforce have significantly boosted the 
productivity of businesses over the last few decades. Along the same 
time frame, e-commerce and more recently, the social media and mobile 
revolution have also reset expectations for on-demand service, online 
procurement, and delivery across supply chains. Next, the deployment 
of artificial intelligence will set new frontiers for productivity. Indeed, 
ChatGPT has set a world record by reaching 100 million users in just two 
months (Hu, 2023)."
"A second driver is governmental regulation. The recent movement 
towards tariffs and trade wars have already been shaping procurement 
practices. Domestic counterpart of these international headwinds are 
taxation, subsidies, and antitrust action. In the long run, climate change 
will also force governments to take action."
"A third driver is demographic diversity. Changing characteristics 
such as average age, discretionary income, ethnic backgrounds, and 
lifestyles of target markets have significant implications for upstream 
B2B markets and procurement as well."
"The fourth driver is the rise of emerging markets and a new world 
order configuration. In terms of purchasing power parity-based GDP, 
China and India have replaced the traditional powerhouses of Europe, 
and Japan to join the United States as triad powers (Sheth, Uslay, & 
Sisodia, 2022; IMF, 2023). Multinational corporations from emerging 
markets are rising to global leadership by utilizing their skill and do­
mestic scale advantages, focused M&A, key account relationships, and 
understanding of emerging markets to switch from offering OEM to 
branded products and services (Sheth, 2011; Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 
2020)."
"An increasingly important fifth area that has been by and large 
ignored until recently is how to deal with ad-hoc global crises. Before 
Covid-19, we had cases and studies that dealt with consumer backlash

(P/R) and disruptions in supply chains (operations) but very little with a 
holistic view of the impact of ad-hoc global crises on B2B marketing."
"Retroactively, we acknowledge that the writing was on the wall. The 
growing incidence of local disasters such as hurricanes, tsunami, 
earthquakes, more recently the Covid-19 pandemic, and finally the war 
in Ukraine all indicate that dealing with unanticipated crises, natural or 
man-made, needs to become part of the skillset executives need to learn 
sooner, or they will have to learn on the job more painfully later.1 
Grewal, Johnson, and Sarker (Grewal et al. (2007)) offered a typology of 
crises using three dimensions: (1) endogenous/exogenous to interfirm 
relationships, (2) localized versus pervasive impact, and (3) slow- 
evolving versus immediate. The Russo-Ukrainian conflict represents a 
special case: Even though it can be considered an exogeneous shock with 
immediate impact for many local/subsidiary businesses that were forced 
to exit, this categorization could be myopic. Even though the war zone 
has been confined so far, the impact of the war in Ukraine on supply 
chains is arguably already global. Similarly, while the lives of many 
citizens and businesses were changed overnight, the pervasive impact 
for the markets in the rest of the world has been slow-evolving and likely 
to remain so."
"In business academia, there is limited literature on the impact of 
wars, such as civil, international, or world wars I or II. Besides the ex­
ceptions in history, journalism, and sociology, other academic disci­
plines are not much more advanced than business in examining the 
context of war. All of this started to change when the pandemic offered a 
costly wake-up call. We applaud the efforts of chief editors, guest edi­
tors, and researchers for their agility in orchestrating, developing, and 
offering special issues and impactful research on Covid-19 on markets 
and marketing."
"Contributing to that backdrop, the purpose of our paper is to 
conceptualize the likely consequences of a prolonged Russia-Ukraine war 
on B2B marketing and supply chains from a contingency theory 
perspective. The reason for our focus is two-fold:  
a) While it is more straightforward to discuss the magnitude and 
speculate on the aftermath of a short conflict, the key consequences 
of a prolonged conflict are much more challenging to anticipate and 
prepare for B2B firms, making it potentially an even more worth­
while topic."
"b) Unfortunately, recent history suggests that the escalated military 
conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to persist for some time."
"Economic embargo against Russia has not achieved devastating 
impact and Russia remains unwilling to give up her claims in 
Ukraine. Russian conflicts elsewhere have persisted. For example, 
Russian military has been deployed in Syria since 2015, and even the 
current war in Ukraine can be traced back to Russia’s annexation of 
Crimea in 2014 (Center for Preventive Action, 2022). It is also not 
possible to count out the scenario that the war could spread to other 
countries/regions in the future."
"We hope that the researchers and practitioners alike will benefit from 
the insights, perspectives, and research questions put forth in this article."
"Given the likelihood of a persistent conflict and future unanticipated 
events, B2B firms need to consider how this and other disruptions could 
affect their operations and prepare accordingly. In addition to antici­
pating the recurring contraction and recovery periods of business cycles 
(Mora Cortez, Johnston, & Ehret, 2023), businesses must assess poten­
tial risks and develop contingency plans in the face of increasing 
geopolitical instability (Sheth & Sisodia, 2006a)."
"2. Crisis uniqueness 
The detestable act of war will undoubtedly have immense conse­
quences for those engaged in it voluntarily or otherwise, including 
innocent citizens. The war will certainly have significant consequences 
even for regions not involved in the conflict directly. For example, 
countries which have been impacted in a significant way, and whose 
geopolitical alignments are being tested include Estonia, Finland, and 
Sweden. Businesses have also been forced to exit markets due to 
geopolitical turbulences; while some never made it back, others had to 
wait on the sidelines for years before re-entering (Yayla et al., 2018)."
"Thus far, over a thousand multinationals have scaled back or suspended 
their operations in Russia whereas over 200 corporations such as 
Dentsu, Honeywell, Kantar, Maersk, McKinsey, International Paper, 
PWC, Scania, Schneider, Siemens, Shell, Tetra Pak, and Otis have 
already exited (for a full list, see Leave-Russia.org)."
"It is worth noting that a unique aspect of the conflict in Ukraine 
(unlike the conflicts in Syria or Afghanistan) is that both countries 
control the supply of a large share of essential raw materials. For 
example, Ukraine produces 10% of wheat, 16% of corn, and 40% of 
sunflower oil globally (Green, 2022). Together, Russia and Ukraine 
export over 25% wheat and almost 80% sunflower oil, and Russia and its 
ally Belarus account for 15% of world’s fertilizer exports (The Guardian, 
2022). Russia produced about 10% world’s oil prior to the invasion of 
Ukraine (Kilian & Plante, 2022) and is also the largest exporter of nat­
ural gas in the world and is home to the world’s largest reserves (USEIA, 
2022). Natural gas is also utilized to produce fertilizers."
"Putting eggs in one/few baskets brings in more vulnerability to 
systemic shocks and diminished supply chain resilience. No doubt then, 
the Russo-Ukrainian war has caused disruption for Egypt, which used to 
import over 80% of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine, and is now 
looking to India in an effort to diversify its suppliers (USDA, 2022), or 
Moldova which sourced over 90% of its wheat from Ukraine. The price 
of wheat in Africa has soared by 45% since the beginning of the war 
(Green, 2022)."
"At any price, the availability of these upstream raw materials deeply 
impacts the ability of manufacturers to produce downstream products 
and can quickly bring assembly lines to a halt. A recent analog to this has 
been recently observed in the production of automotive, consumer 
electronics, LEDs, and power turbines due to shortages in semi­
conductors (Dooley, 2021). The lack of one component can and has 
created major backlogs in production. The most significant and obvious 
risks of the Russo-Ukrainian war to the supply chains are in food security 
due to disruptions in wheat, sunflower oil, and fertilizers and energy 
security due to the disruptions of the supply of oil and natural gas. These 
developments bring about the need for deeper public–private-govern­
ment partnerships and mindful marketing practices in the B2B sector 
(Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011)."
"Against this backdrop, we anticipate eight consequences of a pro­
longed conflict in Ukraine: 1. competition gives way to cartelization, 2."
"diverging power of suppliers as strategic and non-strategic, 3. saved by 
new entrants, especially private equity capitalists, 4. customers strike 
back by backward integration, 5. rise of the substitutes such as alter­
native energy sources and electric vehicles, 6. public policy intervention 
for market security, 7. guns for butter such as barter of raw materials 
with weapons, 8. new bedfellows, especially with resource-rich nations."
"We believe that our long-term view and focus on enduring effects as 
opposed to temporary shocks make these consequences uniquely rele­
vant for successfully forging B2B relationships."
"3. Consequences of prolonged Russo-Ukrainian conflict 
As previously noted, marketing is a contextual discipline, and the 
study of situational effects have been identified as an area of research 
shortage in B2B marketing (Sheth & Sharma, 2006). Increased market 
volatility underlines the importance of environmental fit and 
1 The need for contingency-focused training is now being widely recognized: 
content coverage of disruption management (e.g., supply chain disruptions), 
preparedness, scenario planning, and risk management/reduction are gaining 
ground in executive education as well as traditional curricula. State-of-the-art 
simulations are becoming available (e.g., dealing with cyber-attacks)."
"J.N. Sheth and C. Uslay

adaptability even further (Whalen et al., 2016)."
"Previous prolonged conflicts have also impacted markets in profound 
ways. For example, World War II created a shortage of men in 
employment age and with encouragement by the federal government, 
participation of women in the US workforce increased almost by half, 
and many women occupied positions traditionally held by men (Rose, 
2018). Along with the civil rights movement, World War II helped to 
redefine and significantly broaden “women’s work” and narrow the 
wage gap. Other prolonged conflicts include the civil war in Colombia 
(1964–––2016), Sri Lanka (1983–––2009), Syria (2011 -, and Yemen 
(2014 -."
"While each conflict has had its unique consequences, they have all 
resulted in a surge in the number of refugees. This has also been the case 
in Ukraine. Over eight million refugees have moved to Europe so far and 
even larger numbers were forced to relocate domestically. Evidence 
from Poland and UK suggests that these refugees are able to secure jobs 
and integrate to Europe’s labor force (Bird & Noumon, 2022). Other 
common consequences naturally include reduced foreign investment, 
trade restrictions, damage to reputation in the global arena, security 
risks, exits by foreign businesses, and disrupted supply chains, all of 
which have already been observed in the Russo-Ukrainian war."
"The main premise of contingency theory is that organizational 
effectiveness is a function of the fit between organizational structure, 
strategy, and environment (Chandler, 1962; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967a, 
1967b; Woodward, 1965). Hence, the critical role of external factors 
(market competition, technology change, legal and regulatory envi­
ronment, social and cultural factors and focal to our article, political and 
economic factors) are explicitly recognized."
"Next, we discuss eight anticipated consequences that will result from 
the circumstances of a prolonged conflict from a contingency perspec­
tive (Van de Ven & Drazin, 1984). These consequences are also illus­
trated in Fig. 1."
"1. Competition gives way to cartelization: While conventional thinking 
may view them as opposites, the relationship between the level of 
competition and collaboration in markets is arguably U-shaped 
(Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 2020). That is, collaborative behavior in 
markets is commonplace when competition is low but starts to 
decline as competitive intensity increases. However, when markets 
get too competitive, players are compelled to create pacts and alli­
ances to survive. We have recently observed this phenomenon with 
the Saudi-led OPEC’s alignment with Russia to form OPEC+
(Northam, 2022; Ulrichsen et al., 2022). Repeating the scenario from 
the earlier energy crises of the seventies and from 2003 to 2008 
where the barrel of crude oil reached $147, the likely outcome of 
collusion will be outsized monopoly profits. In fact, oil companies 
have already been reporting record profits thanks to rising com­
modity prices (e.g., Meredith & Amaro, 2022)."
"2. Diverging power of suppliers: We foresee two main pathways for sec­
tors impacted by supply chain disruptions. High value-add sectors (e."
"g., pharmaceuticals) will rely on their margins to find a way to thrive 
despite inflation and rising commodity prices, whereas low value- 
add sectors (e.g., processed foods) will be forced to consolidate."
"Fertilizers are critical for agriculture, whereas oil is essential for 
petrochemicals as well as pharmaceuticals, not to mention trans­
portation. XPO Logistics’ acquisition of Kuehne + Nagel’s European 
operations is a recent example of consolidation (Berman, 2021)."
"3. Saved by private capital: Downstream manufacturers without raw 
materials to operate are likely to face cash flow problems. This will 
present significant opportunities for private equity and sovereign 
funds to come in and acquire them at a discount. This was also the 
pattern observed in the eighties in the aftermath of the first energy 
crisis. While pandemics decrease aggregate demand and do not 
necessarily cause inflation, prolonged wars increase aggregate de­
mand, and are typically followed by higher interest rates, invest­
ment, and inflation (Daly and Chankova (2021)). It is also worth 
noting that multinationals from emerging markets have much more 
experience in dealing with inflationary environments and consoli­
dating markets. As such, they will be more likely to identify oppor­
tunities in what incumbents may view as a highly challenging 
landscape. For example, Temasek of Singapore has recently brokered 
a merger between two struggling investments, Keppel and Sembcorp 
Marine to create the world’s largest oil-rig builder (Burgos, 2022)."

4. Customers strike back: Large B2B customers that fall short in supplies 
and/or increasingly wary of such shortages will look to acquire 
suppliers and integrate backwards. Historically, petro-chemical giant 
Dupont’s record-breaking acquisition of Conoco (then ninth largest 
oil and second largest coal company in US) in 1981 is an example of 
this (Scherer, 1981). A more recent example is LyondellBasell’s 
$2.25B acquisition of A. Schulman in 2018 allowing it to integrate 
deeper to the production of specialized plastics and expand its 
advanced polymer solutions (Goldsberry, 2018)."
"5. Innovations for substitutes: From oil and gas shortages, global sub­
stitutes will emerge. Germany already decided to postpone the 
phasing out of its nuclear power plants and restart using coal-based 
plants to improve its energy security as a temporary measure (Con­
nolly (2022)). Even in the US, there are plans to re-open nuclear 
plants and extend the shut-down dates of existing ones (including the 
last operational plant in environmentally conscious California) 
(Canon, 2022) and President Biden recently approved an eight 
billion-dollar drilling project in Alaska in a reversal of his staunch 
“no more drilling on federal lands, period” campaign position 
(Friedman (2023)). Other nations such as India and Turkey are also 
reconsidering the role of nuclear in their energy portfolio."
"Meanwhile, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Denmark have 
already pledged to increase EU’s offshore wind power capacity by 
tenfold by 2050 (Reuters, 2022). Ultimately, solar and hydrogen power 
will also increase their market share, and substitute for oil and gas."
"Similarly, wheat can be substituted by other grains as it is already the 
case in South Korea with rice flour (Neo, 2022). Potato pulp can serve as 
a partial substitute to wheat and help generate energy- and cost-efficient 
steamed bread with more nutrition (Cao et al., 2019). Cauliflower rice 
has also been trending up as a healthier choice, and some restaurants 
have been successfully experimenting with it (Chipotle (2022)). In India, 
the government is trying to reposition millets (traditionally referred to 
as “poor man’s grain” despite their nutritious content) as a super food 
and supporting the Indian Institute of Millet Research to become a global 
hub for millet R&D (Jain (2023)). In the end, it may not be one grain but 
a combination of them that wins over the consumers, indicating that 
more product innovation on substitutes is inevitable."
"6. Public policy intervention: Private sector lacks both capital and in­
centives to build infrastructure or cope with climate change (Bordoff 
& O’Sullivan, 2022). Therefore, governments will need to intervene 
and make large-scale investments and/or lead public–private co­
alitions. The efforts by Lithuanian and German governments to 
invest in floating liquefied natural gas terminals to diversify sup­
pliers are examples of this (Bordoff & O’Sullivan, 2022)."
"While energy security is top of mind due to the relatively fresh 
memories of the first and second energy crises, food security has always 
been a concern for emerging nations in Africa and elsewhere. Similarly, 
interventions for securing essential minerals such as lithium, nickel and 
cobalt will be next due to their importance in the battery-hungry in­
formation age. Federal regulation will also influence the conduct of state 
and local governments, which in turn will shape the markets. In the end, 
there will be unique opportunities to forge tri-sector collaborations be­
tween the government, the private, and the NGOs for innovative solu­
tions to utilize assets more effectively and address forthcoming 
shortages (Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 2020; Uslay, 2019)."
"7. Guns for butter: Recent headwinds against globalization and global 
trade is likely to spur growth in new bartering arrangements. Bilat­
eral or multilateral barters can uniquely overcome cash flow prob­
lems as well as currency fluctuations. For example, Pepsi is known 
for bartering its soda for Russian vodka and even warships (Ramirez, 
1990). We anticipate that developed countries with advanced 
weapon systems will be willing to sell these in exchange for raw 
materials such as wheat, oil, and gas."
"8. New bedfellows: As previously noted, when competition for scarce 
resources becomes excessive, the outcome is more collaborative 
behavior, coalitions, and new alignments (Sheth, Uslay, & Sisodia, 
2020). Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was raised in 
East Germany and spoke Russian fluently, was able to negotiate a 
natural gas purchase agreement with Russia after the collapse of 
communism (Marton, 2022). She was then able to rationalize shut­
ting down the nuclear plants and garner the political clout to get the 
legislation passed. Two natural gas pipelines (Nord Stream 1 and 2) 
were built and peaceful relationships prevailed between Germany 
and Russia. With the invasion of Ukraine, all of that has changed and 
Germany is currently actively looking for alternative partners/ 
suppliers."
"This implies a seismic shift in geopolitical alignments which in turn 
will shake up B2B markets toward further volatility. A consequence of 
energy/resource crises may be the creation of alternative paradigms/ 
innovations and a more multilateral perspective that makes the world 
less reliant on non-democratic regimes.2 Nevertheless, the choices for 
alternative alignments/partners are not infinite and more difficult due 
to the current geopolitical environment: the US happens to be the 
leading producer of natural gas (934 billion cubic meters), followed by 
Russia (702 bcm), Iran (257 bcm), and China (209 bcm) (Pistilli 2022)."
"Similarly, the US has been the leading producer of oil (18.88 million 
barrels per day), followed by Saudi Arabia (10.84 mbpd), Russia (10.78 
mbpd), and Canada (5.54 mbpd) based on 2021 data (US EIA, 2022)."
"Meanwhile, those already with uneasy relations with the US may end up 
as economic allies of Russia despite their military ties with Western al­
liances with NATO and the EU."
"4. Implications and research questions 
Despite the conventional wisdom that downstream activities have 
higher margins, upstream businesses of raw materials and commodities 
may benefit from even more profits than those with finished branded 
products. For example, PC component (chips and software) manufac­
turers thrive while Dell, Acer, and HP continue to struggle (Sheth, Uslay, 
& Sisodia, 2020). While the common reactions to shortages (hoarding/ 
building reserves and consequently inflation) may initially exacerbate 
the situation, we are hopeful that an alternative, more mindful paradigm 
can emerge."
"Climate change and the rising scarcity of natural resources and 
commodities necessitates marketers to be more mindful of consumption 
(Sheth, Sethia, & Srinivas, 2011). The Russo-Ukranian war has put 
extraordinary strain on the supply chains and accelerated the need to 
transform towards mindful marketing. Mindful (effective, efficient, and 
ethical) marketing facilitates sustainable consumption by simulta­
neously considering the interests of buyers, sellers, and society at large 
as primary stakeholders; in other words, people, planet, and profit (Apte 
& Sheth, 2016; Malhotra, Lee, & Uslay 2012). Consideration of multiple 
stakeholders prevents wasteful, unethical or dumb marketing practices 
that result in over- or under-consumption, and helps to create enduring 
customer value (Sheth & Sisodia, 2006b; Sheth & Uslay, 2022)."
"Similarly, entrepreneurial marketing is commonly employed by B2B 
businesses and is uniquely suited to enhance firm performance, since it 
has been observed and empirically found to be more impactful than 
traditional approaches especially when the markets are turbulent (Alqah­
tani & Uslay, 2020; Alqahtani, Uslay, & Yeniyurt, 2023; Whalen et al., 
2016). Bringing entrepreneurial and mindfulness mindsets together can 
also prove beneficial (Uslay & Erdogan, 2014). Necessity is the mother 
of invention; thus, we fully expect dire circumstances and shortages to 
2 We thank an anonymous reviewer for this keen observation."
"J.N. Sheth and C. Uslay

lead to more innovation which is a natural product of mindful entre­
preneurship. New business applications in the US surged by 24% in 2020 
and set an all-time-record while many existing businesses successfully 
pivoted and adapted during the Covid-19 pandemic (Garcia et al., 2021)."
"There is a need for both conceptual frameworks as well as empirical 
research on ad-hoc black swan events. Development of research pro­
grams with a historical perspective would be a welcome development in 
B2B marketing research just like they have been impactful in manage­
ment (e.g., Carroll & Swaminathan, 2000). We offer ten research ques­
tions based on the eight consequences of a prolonged conflict in Ukraine."
"Admittedly, many of these questions cover key factors, relationships, 
and mechanisms that are broad enough to serve as topics for multiple 
dissertations."
"Can the argued U-shaped relationship between the level of compe­
tition and collaboration be empirically tested in B2B markets? What 
are the key factors that drive this relationship? 
How can alternative market mechanisms such as auctions, platform 
markets, and peer-to-peer networks be used to mitigate the risks of 
cartelization and facilitate competition? 
How do the availability of critical inputs such as fertilizers and oil 
affect the resilience and competitiveness of different B2B sectors, and 
what are the implications for supply chain management and 
strategy? 
Which alternative sourcing strategies, such as local sourcing, vertical 
integration, or diversification are more effective against supply chain 
disruptions and lead to higher bargaining power? 
What are the factors that impact the ability of firms in high value-add 
sectors versus low value-add sectors to cope with inflation and rising 
commodity prices, and what are the implications for industry 
structure and performance? 
What are the antecedents and outcomes of customer-driven (back­
ward) vertical integration in B2B markets, and (how) do these differ 
from other forms of M&A activity? 
How can tri-sector collaborations between the government, private 
sector, and NGOs be structured to encourage innovative solutions 
that address forthcoming shortages in essential resources? 
What are the key drivers and barriers to the adoption of substitutes 
for oil and gas, and how can public–private partnerships accelerate 
the transition to alternative energy sources? 
What role can bartering arrangements play in the development and 
adoption of new technologies such as renewable energy and digital 
currencies? What are the implications for sustainable development 
and economic growth? 
Can event history analysis be used to examine the impact of wars and 
other conflicts on B2B markets? 
In conclusion, the Russo-Ukrainian war has had far-reaching impact 
for B2B markets and supply chains, prompting firms to adapt and seek 
innovative solutions. The conflict has highlighted the importance of 
improvisation and the development of new sourcing strategies. B2B 
firms are actively diversifying their approaches to sourcing and 
exploring alternative ingredients, components, and energy sources to 
mitigate supply chains disruptions. This article focused on eight key 
consequences of a prolonged conflict, shedding light on implications for 
B2B markets and relationships. As the conflict progresses, it will be 
crucial for businesses to remain agile, resilient, and proactive in navi­
gating the evolving landscape shaped by these geopolitical challenges."
"We certainly hope that our pessimistic expectation and concerns do not 
come true, and that the Russo-Ukrainian conflict can be resolved soon."
"Alas, we already see varying levels of evidence for each of these con­
sequences, which increases our confidence in their relevance and the 
need to prepare for them. Given the importance of economics in driving 
politics, we hope B2B firms can aggregate their lobbying power and 
connections and join the effort to market peace around the world (Kotler 
(2022))."
