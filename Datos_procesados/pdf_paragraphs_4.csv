Abstract
This paper uses a product-level empirical model of bilateral trade to examine the
global trade implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The results show that
imports from Ukraine were 47.3% below the counterfactual between February and
August 2022. The Russia-Ukraine war led to signiﬁcant trade diversion for Russia,
primarily beneﬁting Russian mineral oil and gas exports to Europe and Asia. The
analysis also reveals that the trade adjustments operate mainly through import price
hikes, with notable heterogeneity across product groups and regions. The ﬁndings
indicate that the Ukraine-Russia war had signiﬁcant trade implications for Ukraine
and Russia but only limited ones for other countries."

"1. Introduction
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused considerable human suﬀering and harmed global trade
(Ruta 2022). According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global economic outlook has
worsened since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, 2022, with trade growth pro-
jected to fall from 4.7% to less than 3.4% (WTO 2022). Ukraine and Russia are major commodity
exporters. Ukraine, in particular, ships most of its products by sea, and the conﬂict has greatly
limited this mode of transport. Russia, in contrast, faces substantial economic sanctions that im-
pact the domestic economy and limits its ability to participate in global markets. Both mechanisms
led to a worldwide reallocation of trade ﬂows for commodities, such as base metals, mineral oils,
and agricultural products (Borin et al. 2022; Bentley et al. 2022). This paper provides the ﬁrst
ex-post empirical analysis of the global trade reallocation eﬀects caused by the Russia-Ukraine war,
using detailed trade data and theory-consistent empirical models to quantify the degree of trade
destruction and diversion resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
"A growing literature investigates the economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. Studies
have examined a range of topics, including economic growth (Mahlstein et al. 2022), stock market
performance (Boungou and Yati´
e 2022), commodity markets (Fang and Shao 2022), and food
security (Behnassi and El Haiba 2022; Carriquiry et al. 2022). Borin et al. (2022) developed a
theoretical model to show that the extent of the economic eﬀects depends on the ability of a
country to diversify its supply chains. Ruta (2022) conducted an ex-ante simulation that predicts
global trade to decrease by 1% in 2022, reducing the global gross domestic product by 0.7%. Other
ex-ante studies have simulated the implications of economic sanctions on trade (Allen 2022; Estrada
and Koutronas 2022), analyzed pre-war grain market trade dependencies (Glauben et al. 2022), and
explored measures to ensure food security (Bentley et al. 2022). In an ex-post analysis for grain and
oilseed trade, Ahn et al. (2023) ﬁnd that imports from Ukraine were 78.2% lower between February
and July 2022. They show that the Ukraine-Russia war had substantial trade implications for the
directly involved countries but only limited ones for global grain and oilseed markets."
"The paper utilizes a product-level empirical model of bilateral trade to assess the ex-post trade
eﬀects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Drawing on recent contributions to the international
1
"
"trade and policy literature (Arita et al. 2022; Steinbach 2022; Ahn et al. 2023), a counterfactual
identiﬁcation strategy is used that measures the trade destruction and diversion eﬀects at the prod-
uct and region levels. The estimates reveal that imports from Ukraine were 47.3% or $19.4 billion
below the counterfactual level between February and August 2022. Reduced exports of agricultural
commodities and base metals drive those trade losses. In contrast, Russia recorded trade grains
that pushed imports 15.7% above the counterfactual. Higher mineral exports, which increased by
more than $61.2 billion between February and August 2022, drove the trade gains. Russia realized
those trade gains mainly with Asia, which imported more than $41.1 billion of additional prod-
ucts. There is further evidence of trade diversion with countries other than Russia and Ukraine,
particularly in South America, North America, Europe, and Africa, being most pronounced for
agricultural commodities and mineral products. The ﬁndings suggest that the Ukraine-Russia war
had signiﬁcant trade implications for the directly involved countries but only limited ones for the
global markets. Lastly, the empirical results prove that global market adjustments operated mainly
through increased commodity prices."
"The paper makes two distinct contributions to the growing literature on the economic consequences
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Firstly, it is the ﬁrst study to utilize counterfactual statistical
methods to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on international
trade. These ﬁndings extend previous ex-ante studies on the trade eﬀects of economic sanctions and
trade blockages and ex-post studies on the product-speciﬁc trade eﬀects (Allen 2022; Estrada and
Koutronas 2022; Ahn et al. 2023). Secondly, the paper documents the global reallocation dynamics
for diﬀerent product groups and regions. It shows how the trade eﬀects of the Russia-Ukraine war
operate primarily through import price adjustments. These insights are essential, as earlier ex-
ante simulation studies have warned of supply constraints and their implications for global markets
(Bentley et al. 2022; Glauben et al. 2022; Ruta 2022)."
"2. Empirical Strategy and Data
This paper uses event study methods to examine the short-run global trade eﬀects of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine."
"The empirical strategy is based on the isomorphic gravity equation and
recent developments in the ﬁeld of international trade, which allow for the identiﬁcation of ex-post
2
"
"treatment dynamics and the evaluation of the global trade reallocation eﬀects (Arita et al. 2022;
Carter et al. 2022). A dynamic treatment model that includes leads and lags relative to the event
of interest is utilized, enabling the capture of pre-trends and the assessment of post-treatment
dynamics (Freyaldenhoven et al. 2021). The trade eﬀects of the Russia-Ukraine war are quantiﬁed
using a non-linear panel regression model for count data, as proposed by Steinbach (2022), with
the following regression equation:
yijpt = exp
 
αijp,mo + αijp,yr +
6
X
m=−6
βmrijp,t−m
!
ηijpt ,
(1)
where i, j, p, and t represent the importer, exporter, product, and month, respectively."
"The
outcome of interest is represented by yijpt, which maps into import value and unit value, while
the multiplicative error term is represented by ηijpt."
"It is assumed that all latent confounders
are captured by the high-dimensional ﬁxed eﬀects deﬁned at the importer-exporter-product-event-
month (αijp,mo) and importer-exporter-product-event-year (αijp,yr) levels. The model addresses
diﬀerences in import volumes through the importer-exporter-product-event-year ﬁxed eﬀects and
accounts for seasonal patterns in trade with importer-exporter-product-event-month ﬁxed eﬀects."
"In addition, the ﬁxed eﬀects account for unobserved trade costs, such as cultural, border, and
proximity eﬀects, and trade integration agreements (Carter et al. 2022). For instance, mineral oil
and gas imports could face pre-existing trends and seasonality patterns in import values."
"The term P6
m=−6 βmrijp,t−m measures the dynamic treatment eﬀects of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, which occurred in February 2022 and serves as the center point of the event study. Trade
data from 2017 to 2021 are used as the control group, following the counterfactual evaluation
approach developed by Arita et al. (2022) and Steinbach (2022), who analyzed the trade eﬀects
of the coronavirus pandemic and the 2012/2022 U.S. container shipping disruptions, respectively."
"The Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PML) estimator is employed to identify the parameters
of interest, with the iteratively re-weighted least-squares algorithm being utilized to account for
the high-dimensional ﬁxed eﬀects (Silva and Tenreyro 2006; Correia et al. 2020). Mullahy and
Norton (2022) demonstrated that the Poisson estimator is more suitable than transforming the
outcome when examining marginal eﬀects. As the standard errors are suspected to be correlated at
3
"
"the importer-exporter-product level, they are clustered in this manner (Cameron and Miller 2015;
Steinbach 2022)."
"Detailed trade data at the Harmonized System (HS) chapter level (HS-2) were obtained from the
Trade Data Monitor (2022).1 The ﬁnal balanced panel dataset consists of monthly import values
and unit values for 107 reporting countries and 190 partner countries at the HS-chapter level from
August 2017 to July 2022.2
The trade data are mirrored due to Russia ceasing the reporting
of monthly trade statistics in February 2022."
"The event study panel is constructed using this
dataset and allows for measuring the degree of trade destruction and diversion resulting from the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ﬁnal panel includes 410,142 unique importer-exporter-product
pairs imported under 99 HS chapters.3
3. Results
Figure 1 presents event study estimates for the global trade eﬀects of the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, comparing the import value and unit value eﬀects for Ukraine, Russia, and the Rest of
the World. Each subﬁgure displays the dynamic treatment parameters, 95% conﬁdence intervals,
and uniform sup-t bands for the event-time of the outcome, as described in Montiel Olea and
Plagborg-Møller (2019) and Freyaldenhoven et al. (2021). The estimates for a static regression
model are also shown, with test statistics for pre-trends and leveling-oﬀtreatment eﬀects reported
in the ﬁgure notes. The analysis found no statistically signiﬁcant pre-trends, indicating that the
Russian invasion of Ukraine is exogenous to the outcomes of interest (Freyaldenhoven et al. 2019;
Sun and Abraham 2021; Roth 2022). Given the use of importer-exporter-product-event-year and
importer-exporter-product-event-month ﬁxed eﬀects, the treatment group exhibits similar trends
in the pre-treatment period to the control groups, validating the research design. At the same
time, there is limited evidence for leveling-oﬀtreatment eﬀects for Ukraine and Russia, but some

evidence for the Rest of the World.
"The estimation results indicate that imports from Ukraine experienced a signiﬁcant decline of 47.3%
from February to August 2022.4 This decrease in trade can be attributed to adverse eﬀects that
accumulated until March 2022, leading to a persistent depression of imports from Ukraine at -55.5%
of the counterfactual level from April to August 2022. In contrast, the analysis reveals positive
post-event treatment eﬀects for Russia and other countries. The average trade eﬀect for Russia
was 15.7%, while it was 11.2% for all other countries.5 Imports from Russia experienced a notable
increase of 20.8% above the counterfactual level from March to June 2022, although economic
sanctions subsequently reduced these trade gains to statistically insigniﬁcant levels. The analysis
also found signiﬁcant unit value eﬀects, with unit values for imports from Ukraine, Russia, and
other countries being 12.8%, 18.8%, and 3.2% higher, respectively. Because the average post-event
trade eﬀect is larger for the unit value speciﬁcation (18.8%) than for the value speciﬁcation (15.7%),
there is some evidence for trade destruction in volume terms for Russia. In contrast, the increase
in unit values for Ukraine suggests that Ukrainian exporters continued exporting higher-priced
varieties while reducing exports of lower-valued products."
"Figure 2 shows diﬀerences in the average post-event trade eﬀects and Figure 3 the corresponding
trade gains and losses by HS section. Starting with Ukraine, there is signiﬁcant heterogeneity in
the treatment eﬀects across HS sections, with the largest average post-event trade eﬀects observed
for arms and ammunition (Section 19, -91.0%), animal and vegetable fats (Section 3, -71.0%), and
base metals (Section 15, -67.0%). In terms of trade value, imports from Ukraine were $19.4 billion
below the counterfactual between February and August 2022, with the largest trade losses occurring
in vegetable products (Section 2, -$5.3 billion), base metals (Section 15, -$5.5 billion), and animal
and vegetable fats (Section 3, -$4.3 billion). In contrast, Russia experienced signiﬁcantly smaller

"5 Appendix Figure A.1 presents robustness checks for potential pre-trends. Under the assumption that pre-trends
would have continued linearly in the post-treatment period, we estimate Equation 1 following the approach outlined
in Dobkin et al. (2018). The results show no evidence of signiﬁcant linear pre-trend eﬀects for Ukraine and Russia."
"When accounting for these pre-trends, the average post-event trade eﬀects for Ukraine, Russia, and the Rest of the
World are -48.4%, -3.3%, and -2.8%, respectively. These results suggest that the main estimates likely represent
the upper bound of the treatment eﬀect range."

"adverse trade eﬀects, with arms imports (Section 19) from Russia decreasing the most with -68.2%."
"However, this estimate is statistically insigniﬁcant at conventional levels. At the same time, imports
of Russian mineral products (Section 5) saw a 31.7% increase above the counterfactual level between
February and August 2022, resulting in $68.3 billion in additional imports from Russia. Without
the higher energy imports, trade with Russia would have been $7.1 billion lower during this period."
"Lastly, the Rest of Section World experienced no signiﬁcant adverse trade disruptions, with imports
of arms and ammunition (Section 19) growing by 51.4%, followed by mineral products (Section 5,
47.2%) and footwear (Section 12, 35.6%). The substantial increase in imports of mineral products
can be attributed to the post-Covid trade recovery and positive commodity price eﬀects due to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine.6
The average post-event treatment eﬀects and estimated trade gains and losses by region are pre-
sented in Figure 4. South America, Africa, and Asia experienced the largest reduction in imports
from Ukraine, with declines of 79.6%, 78.8%, and 72.9%, respectively, between February and Au-
gust 2022. In terms of import value for Ukraine, Asia saw the most considerable reduction at $12.3
billion, followed by Europe ($4.0 billion) and Africa ($1.5 billion). Lower imports of agricultural
products and base metal drove the decrease in imports. In contrast, Asia (26.7%) and Europe
(11.3%) increased their imports from Russia beyond the counterfactual level. The most substan-
tial trade gains were seen for Russian exports to Asia ($41.1 billion) and Europe ($18.1 billion),
while Russia experienced trade losses of $2.3 billion in North America. Higher imports of mineral
products drove the increase in Russian exports.7 There is evidence of trade diversion with coun-
tries other than Russia and Ukraine beyond the counterfactual level, particularly in North America
(18.5%), Asia (7.6%), and Europe (7.5%)."
"6 Appendix Figure A.2 depicts estimates of the average post-event trade eﬀects for the unit value. Mineral products
(Section 5) were 22.4% more expensive than under the counterfactual scenario. Similar patterns are observed for
animal and vegetable fats (Section 3, 10.2%) and stone products (Section 13, 8.5%)."
"7 Appendix Figure A.3 shows that higher commodity prices contributed to Russian trade gains in Europe. In contrast,
Asian countries also signiﬁcantly expanded their import volume, particularly Russian oil and gas. All other regions
considerably reduced imports of Russian products."

"4. Conclusion
This paper investigates the reallocation of global trade in response to the Russia-Ukraine war using
detailed trade data and theory-consistent empirical models. The analysis utilizes counterfactual
evaluation methods and ﬁnds that Ukraine experienced signiﬁcant export disruptions. Compared
with the counterfactual, imports from Ukraine were 47.3% lower between February and August
2022. In contrast, Russia experienced a more negligible impact from the war, realizing signiﬁcant
trade gains in Europe and Asia reinforced by higher prices for mineral products."
"The Russia-
Ukraine war resulted in considerable trade diversion, beneﬁting countries in North America and
Europe. Notably, the adjustment of global trade is primarily driven by commodity price hikes,
with substantial heterogeneity observable across product groups and regions."
"The ex-ante analysis suggests that the Ukraine-Russia war had signiﬁcant but heterogeneous im-
plications for the directly involved countries but only limited eﬀects on global markets for most
commodities."
"The results also indicate that economic sanctions imposed by Western countries
against Russia were slow to limit Russian exports of mineral oils and other products. The consider-
able trade diversion is due to non-compliance with ﬁnancial sanctions by Russian trading partners
in Asia, Europe, and South America. In addition, the empirical ﬁndings point toward persistent
trade disruptions for Ukraine in agricultural products and base metals, highlighting the economic
and political importance of regaining foreign market access for Ukrainian exporters."
"Further work might study how aﬀected ﬁrms adjusted their supplier and customer networks in
response to the trade disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine."
"Trade costs are
instrumental in forming such networks, implying that the trade shock caused by the Russia-Ukraine
war may induce long-term and heterogeneous disruptions to those networks that vary with proximity
and ﬁrm characteristics (Bernard and Moxnes 2018). Lastly, while this research speaks to the foreign
trade response to the Russia-Ukraine war, an additional adjustment mechanism worth exploring is
the domestic price response to the armed conﬂict (Korovkin and Makarin 2023)."
