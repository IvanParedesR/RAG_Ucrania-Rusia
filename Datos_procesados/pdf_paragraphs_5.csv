This paper looks at war-induced migration flows from Ukraine to Poland and Germany in 2022 to understand 
who is migrating and the challenges they face. Data were collected in the spring and summer of 2022 through 
survey questionnaires and interviews. The results of the research reveal that a) this wave of migration from 
Ukraine is overwhelmingly female; b) women are often migrating with children, which makes arranging 
appropriate childcare and school placement essential to their entry into the destination workforce; c) Ukrainian 
labor migration patterns before the war have had a significant impact on current flows; d) Ukrainian refugees to 
Poland and Germany often want to be able to travel regularly back to Ukraine; this affects their willingness to 
apply for temporary protection schemes that oblige them to remain in destination countries, which in turn makes 
it difficult to precisely quantify the number of refugees in a given country."
"1. Introduction1 
The movement of forced migrants and refugees fleeing from the war 
in Ukraine that began in February 2022 represents Europe's most sig­
nificant wave of migration since World War II. At least 7 million people 
are estimated to have left the country in 2022 (Statista report on Russia- 
Ukraine conflict 2021-2022 - Statistics & facts, 2023). A similar number 
are internally displaced, having moved from war zones in the south and 
east towards western Ukraine. The number of international and internal 
migrants likely exceeds 12–14 million (United Nations High Commis­
sioner on Human Rights, n.d.; United Nations High Commissioner on 
Human Rights, 2022). This is more than a quarter of the country's 
population of 44 million. This paper puts this movement of Ukrainians in 
a historical perspective, describing patterns of movement to and from 
Ukraine during the Soviet period and in the aftermath of the collapse of 
the Soviet Union (Karpova, 2005; Malynovska et al., 2005; Vollmer & 
Malynovska, 2016). These earlier patterns, particularly “circular” labor 
migration patterns to Poland and neighboring European countries after 
1991, set the stage for patterns we see today."
"This article has three objectives. First, it describes the migration of 
Ukrainian refugees to Poland and Germany, focusing on who the mi­
grants are and how the reception of refugees has differed in these two 
countries. Second, it highlights the impact of the feminized nature of this 
migration on the concerns and decision-making of refugees, including 
whether they apply for asylum. Third, it begins to explore how the fact 
that many women are traveling with children – usually but not always 
their own – affects their needs upon arrival and their ability to meet the 
challenges of resettlement."
"Scholars writing since February 2022 emphasize the distinctive 
character of this war and the difficulties it creates for classification and 
analysis (Yekelchyk, 2022). This paper uses a descriptive-explorative 
approach to data collection and analysis, focusing on defining the 
major characteristics of war-induced displacement from Ukraine. We 
focus on Ukrainian migration to Poland and Germany in 2022. The sit­
uation on the ground remains fluid as migration patterns respond to an 
evolving military conflict. For example, Russia's targeting of energy 
infrastructure in autumn and winter 2022–23 led refugees who hoped to 
return to Ukraine to delay their return. This research should therefore be

taken as a snapshot of the situation one year into this bloody and tragic 
war."
"We do not know exactly who is crossing the border into Ukraine. Is it 
women who fled but left their elderly parents behind? Are they volun­
teers delivering humanitarian aid? Or so-called “pendulum” labor mi­
grants who go back and forth every few weeks or months to work? Are 
the returnees returning for good or just visiting? Our survey of Ukrainian 
migrants to Poland and Germany tried to answer these questions."
"An essential feature of this migration is that people who have left 
Ukraine often go back and forth over the border for various reasons."
"Border checkpoint data captures only the number of people entering and 
out of the country. This explains the otherwise mystifying data updated 
daily on the UNHCR website: as of 17 January 2023, 7,977,980 “refu­
gees from Ukraine [were] recorded across Europe.” 4,940,057 were 
registered for Temporary Protection or “similar national protection 
schemes” in Europe.2 Scrolling down on the UNHCR Operational Data 
Portal for the Ukraine Refugee Situation, one finds that there have been 
17,688,845 border crossings from Ukraine since February 2022 to 
February 2023; and 9,585,700 border crossings into Ukraine over the 
same period."
"Our study draws on two streams of literature. The first concerns the 
feminization of migration, a concept that originated in broader studies 
of migration and labor migration (Sassen, 2000; Jones, 2008; Piper, 
2008a, 2008b; Paiewonsk, 2009). The second includes studies and re­
ports that discuss the demographics, needs, and concerns of war-forced 
migrants (CMR Spotlights, 2022, 2023; Juran & Broer, 2017; Ambrosini 
et al., 2019). War-related migration has historically been associated 
with young men seeking to avoid military conscription; these men would 
be first to depart, later sending money home or attempting to reunite 
their families (Dragostinova, 2016). Feminist scholars pointed out that 
“war and migration too have been generally analyzed and understood as 
male domains” and argued for a change in focus (Haleh, 2007). To 
bridge these two streams, we offer a historical perspective that argues 
that Ukrainian migration to Europe before the war shaped later migra­
tion patterns. As with other studies (Goodman et al., 2017), we found it 
difficult to operationalize the formal legal definition of a refugee. Given 
that our interest in this paper is in exploring major features of female- 
dominated displacement rather than the legal definition of a refugee 
per se, we use the terms “refugee,” “forced migrant,” and “war-induced 
migrant” interchangeably."
"Throughout history, women have migrated in significant num­
bers–sometimes more than men– and from different countries. Migra­
tion flows to Italy from Ukraine, Cape Verde, and 13 of 30 Latin 
American countries, for example, have been dominated by women. In 
the Philippines and Sri Lanka in the 2000s, women constituted the 
majority among those who moved abroad to work or to live. In the early 
2000s, more than half of Indonesians who migrated for work were 
women. Similarly, Central and South American women accounted for 
the majority of migrants to Spain. And Caribbean women migrants have 
outnumbered men in moving to North America since the 1950s (Caritas, 
2012)."
"When researchers refer to the feminization of migration, they are not 
just flagging the increasing share of women in migration flows. Female 
migration is not the same as male migration, and it is evolving. Women 
refugees are among the most vulnerable of migrants. They may be vic­
tims of violence, sometimes systematic, including rape and assault, and 
they often migrate with their children (Regional Representation for 
Central Europe & United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 
2008; Bhuyan et al., 2016; Malakooti & Davin, 2015). But only a mi­
nority of displaced women are granted refugee status (Harris, 2000)."
"Due to the weaker position of women and girls in their home country, 
they frequently lack the means to travel and may not know enough 
about their rights or have the skills to complete the bureaucratic 
application process (Regional Representation for Central Europe & 
United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2008). More and 
more women are migrating independently as breadwinners instead of 
following their husbands or male relatives as family dependents (Elm­
hirst, 2007; Leal et al., 2019; Piper & Yamanaka, 2005). The scale of 
these changes and their impact, in particular for children and other 
family members left behind, has received increasing attention world­
wide and in Ukraine."
"Before the war, research on feminization of migration flows from 
different countries including Ukraine concentrated on changing 
employment and demographic trends in destination countries as a pull 
factor. Later on the focus shifted to specific gendered experiences of 
female migrants (see: Harney, 2011; Kindler, 2011; Mudrak, 2011; 
Solari, 2017; Volodko, 2011, 2015). More recent literature has exam­
ined new phenomena like the so-called “social care” or “social gap,” 
“mobility orphans” and “grandmothering” (Fedyuk, 2016; Vollmer & 
Malynovska, 2016; Kupets, 2016). These studies also highlighted the 
risk of human trafficking these women were facing (Kindler, 2011; 
Caritas, 2012). Our study develops this line of research further by 
looking at one of the first war-forced wave of migration from Ukraine."
"This study builds on the broader paradigm and considers women's 
subjectivities to supplement descriptive (Vang et al., 2016)."
"2. Results and discussion 
This paper examines the demographic characteristics, migration 
journey, and concerns of Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Germany (see 
Table 1). The research was undertaken in early March 2022 as the first 
waves of war refugees fled from Ukraine. The data were collected on-site 
at refugees reception points (CAPI) and online (CAWI) (Isa´
nski et al., 
2022). In June a similar survey was run in Germany; in depth interviews 
were conducted May–September 2022 in both Poland and Germany."
"Trained interviewers conducted 523 surveys at Polish reception centers 
for Ukrainian refugees in Ukrainian (413), Russian (77), and English 
(42). The questionnaire asked respondents about their education, lan­
guage proficiency, and professional experience as well as about their 
plans, needs and concerns. In Germany 571 respondents answered in 
Ukrainian (399) or Russian (172). Semi-structured interviews were then 
conducted May–June 2022 with 22 displaced Ukrainians in Poland (18 
women, 4 men) and in May–September 2022 with 10 displaced Ukrai­
nians in Germany (9 women, 1 man). Intertwined respondents were 
chosen based on their agreement to participate in further study during 
the survey. The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Department of Sociology, Adam Mickiewicz University (Pozna´
n, 
Poland), with special attention paid to the fact that research subjects 
belonged to the vulnerable group of displaced persons (see Table 1)."
"Polish survey respondents had worked in many professions, with 
several reporting multiple occupational categories. 14 % of respondents 
were entrepreneurs or IT specialists. A quarter had previously worked as 
scientists, engineers, and health or education specialists. The Ukrainians 
in Poland were somewhat less highly skilled than those in Germany but 
many of those interviewed were professionals (21 % in Poland vs. 44 % 
in Germany), white-collar workers (12 % in Poland vs. 26 % in Ger­
many), or had service skills (27 % in Poland) in high demand (see sec­
tion below for details). Ten percent, for example, had hotel and 
2 All EU Member States have implemented the Temporary Protection Direc­
tive which offers expedited stay, residence and work status for Ukrainian citi­
zens and eligible Ukrainian residents leaving Ukraine. The Directive applies to 
Ukrainian citizens; foreign citizens residents in Ukraine; and spouses or part­
ners, minor children, and cohabiting dependent family members of these in­
dividuals resident in Ukraine on or before February 24, 2022. However, EU 
Member States may introduce variations in the scope of support provided, scope 
of eligible applicants and local application processes. In Germany, applicants 
are registered in a specific place and changing location is difficult. If a person 
applies for the asylum, s/he will be assigned to a Federal L¨
ander (state); each 
county has fixed admission quotas designed to ensure a fair distribution of 
asylum seekers among Federal L¨
ander. The asylum seeker is obliged to remain 
in that state over the course of the asylum process, which may last years."

restaurant experience. About 16 % of respondents had worked as per­
sonal caregivers or domestic staff, and 19 % had been drivers, farmers, 
construction, or sales workers. The most commonly spoken foreign 
language among adult refugees surveyed was English: 26 % said they 
were fluent and another 18 % claimed elementary knowledge; Polish 
was second with 3 % fluent and 12 % having elementary skills. 6 % of 
adults claimed some knowledge of German, 7 % of Italian, and 3 % of 
French."
"Respondents interviewed in Germany in June had similar charac­
teristics: three-quarters were women; 54 % had traveled with children; 
15 % were over 60 years old; 79 % had higher education and 13 % had 
completed vocational training. The findings are consistent with the re­
sults of a survey conducted by the German government in March 2022, 
in which 86 % of respondents were women; 55 % arrived with children; 
and 6 % were over 60 years old. 73 % had higher education and 19 % 
had vocational education; 64 % were previously employed and another 
22 % were self-employed (German Federal Ministry of the Interior and 
Homeland (BMI), 2022). In terms of previous employment, the top three 
sectors included management (15 % of respondents), education (15 %), 
service (8 %), and 17 % were self-employed. 19 % said they knew some 
English, though 13 % categorized their proficiency as basic; 13 % knew 
German (12 % basic), and 5 % knew Polish (4 % basic)."
"Before discussing these populations in detail, a few words about how 
two countries, Poland and Germany, have met the challenge of Ukrai­
nian forced migration. We focus on these countries because they have 
received the highest number of Ukrainian refugees since the full-scale 
war began in February 2022. Of the roughly 5 million Ukrainian refu­
gees in Europe, 1.5 million are in Poland and about 1 million are in 
Germany (United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2023)."
"Poland and Ukraine have centuries of shared history and before the full- 
scale war, and Poland hosted Europe's most extensive Ukrainian labor 
migration diaspora. Germany was the leading destination for Ukrainian 
asylum seekers. Russian aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and espe­
cially after the full-scale attack in February 2022 triggered solidarity and 
spontaneous aid initiatives for Ukrainian refugees in both Poland and 
Germany (Duszczyk & Kaczmarczyk, 2022; Isa´
nski et al., 2022; Sereda 
et al., 2022; Staniszewski, 2022)."
"2.1. The response in Poland 
According to Polish Border Guard data, in the first year of the war, 
over 9.5 million people crossed the Polish-Ukrainian border into Poland 
(UNHCR data portal), with over 100,000 crossing each day at the peak 
in March–April 2022. During the first days of the war, thousands of 
volunteers and NGOs rushed to the border to offer material aid to the 
arriving refugees. A report by the UN Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of migrants noted in July that authorities in Poland worked to 
simplify procedures and maximize border entry capacity to facilitate the 
speedy entry of refugees. Reception centers and a first-point contact 
network were set up to address medical and humanitarian needs and 
provide transportation and accommodation information (Morales, 
2022)."
"The arrival into Poland was often a huge relief for the Ukrainians, 
who had been waiting in lines, in the cold, often without food, water or 
toilets for up to 12 h. One woman now in Poland explained what it was 
like to approach the border: 
‘We got out of the taxi and saw this huge line. The queue was several 
kilometers long… There were bio-toilets, and Polish volunteers 
entered Ukrainian territory and pitched tents. They kept us warm."
"They offered us instant noodles, tea, and all sorts of bars. The chil­
dren were very happy. There was fire and blankets. We lasted from 
12 am to 5 am in this terrible cold.’ 
Aid originally organized privately became institutionalized in the 
first weeks. Private individuals, NGOs and local authorities worked to 
coordinate their efforts. In cities relatively close to the Polish border, 
such as Lublin, city officials volunteered to help the forced migrants 
(Baszczak et al., 2022). The Polish parliament responded to the influx of 
refugees by passing an Act on Assistance for Ukrainian nationals in 
March 2022. The act allowed Ukrainian residents to register for a PESEL 
(the Polish acronym for “Universal Electronic System for Registration of 
the Population”) ID number from mid-April. Once registered, they were 
allowed to legally stay in Poland for 18 months, work, and get access to 
free health care. (Previously, one had to be temporarily or permanently 
in Poland for over three months to get a PESEL number). Ukrainian 
children could go to school free of charge. Arriving Ukrainians were also 
eligible for other social benefits, including a monthly child allowance of 
105 euros (PLN 500) per child, the same as Polish children (Morales, 
2022). Over 950,000 Ukrainian refugees received one-off cash payments 
of approximately 64 Euros (PLN 300) per person and free in-kind 
assistance (e.g. clothes, hygiene products, food, internet cards) during 
the first month of their stay in Poland. The law also transferred funds to 
municipalities that were used to reimburse Poles for expenses if they 
provided food and housing to Ukrainian refugees at a rate of 8.6 Euros 
(PLN 40) for up to 120 days (Polish Economic Institute, 2022). Ukrai­
nians were also given access to free public transportation (railways, 
buses, city trams). By the end of 2022, the Polish government was on 
track to have spent $8.3 billion on housing and other support for

Ukrainian refugees (Higgins, 2022)."
"Yet it was not only the Polish NGOs, local authorities, and govern­
ment that stepped up to help Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland."
"Humanitarian and international organizations set up warming tents and 
stations where refugees could get hot food, information, medical 
attention, and rides into Poland. By the beginning of March, the Inter­
national Organization for Migration (IOM) had set up nine Reception 
Centers along the border to provide support to refugees–Ukrainians and 
often overlooked non-Ukrainians – including legal counseling and help 
finding accommodations (IOM, 2022a). Within a week, the IOM was 
also providing wheelchairs, laundry machines, baby baths, clothing, and 
mobile charging stations (IOM, 2022b). However, their presence was 
incomparably smaller than the response of local civil society and self-aid 
groups."
"Poles also responded personally to the crisis (Staniszewski, 2022). By 
the end of July, the UN estimated that over 2 million Ukrainians were 
staying in private Polish homes (Isa´
nski et al., 2022; Morales, 2022). By 
April, one in 8 respondents in the bordering south-east Podkarpackie 
region reported that they had provided housing to Ukrainian refugees 
(Polish Economic Institute, 2022). The border town of Rzesz´
ow had 
already grown by over 50 %, Gdansk and Katowice by over 30 %. After a 
month of the war, the population of Warsaw had grown by 15 %, 
reaching 2 million souls for the first time (Fusiek, 2022; Union of Polish 
Metropolies, 2022). A survey of 2200 Poles by the Polish Economic 
institute in the spring found that over 70 % of respondents reported that 
they had helped Ukrainian refugees during the first months of the crisis; 
59 % had purchased essential items for them, 53 % donated money, 
17–20 % volunteered to help sort out problems, 7 % said they made their 
home or uninhabited properties available to refugees, 6 % helped find 
employment and 5 % organized transport from the border (Polish Eco­
nomic Institute, 2022)."
"The warmth of the Poles waiting just across the border was evident to 
a 29-year old Ukrainian woman as she crossed the border: 
… I saw crowds of volunteers who ran to meet us. They grabbed bags, 
children, helped old people and women with children. They invited 
me to the heating point, there was hot food, tea, coffee, sandwiches."
"For small children there were diapers, formula, there were strollers 
for babies. There were also Red Cross tents where you could get 
medical help. There was a lot of attention and care.’ 
We wanted to understand what Ukrainian refugees who had settled 
in Poland and Germany needed, and asked respondents to list their most 
urgent needs (see Tables 2 and 3). Ukrainian refugees in Poland listed 
material assistance like food and clothing (57 % of respondents), 
housing (29 %), and medical care (9 %) (Isa´
nski et al., 2022). The fact 
that housing was a concern for only a third of respondents suggests that 
they had already managed to secure reliable shelter. Respondents were 
concerned about finding a job, but much less so than their compatriots in 
Germany (see Tables 2 and 3)."
"Although the 2022 wave of Ukrainian arrivals to Poland was driven 
by war rather than a search for labor, finding work was a priority for 
many. Legally employed Ukrainians pay into the social security system 
(ZUS). Before the war, some 627,000 Ukrainians were registered in the 
ZUS database (Mrugała & Tomczyk, 2022: 9). In 2022, over half a 
million Ukrainians registered with the system, 66.8 % of whom were 
women. Most of these women (72.3 %) had temporary work, a number 
lower than that of men– only 58 % of men had temporary work, with the 
rest permanently employed. December statistics showed that 766,000 
Ukrainians, both labor migrants and refugees, were officially employed 
in Poland (Nowosielska & Otto, 2022)."
In-depth interviews allow us to look behind promising statistics.
"Almost all our respondents in Poland told us that they already had PESEL 
IDs and some work. In many cases, however, the work was low-skilled, 
low-paid, and difficult. One 29-year old woman in Poland described how 
she is employed: “We work at a factory that makes soft upholstery for 
sofas and armchairs. … The work is hard, there is too much dust, it is 
very difficult to breathe there, but since we need money, we agreed to 
this work. We work from 14:00 to 19:00 every day. … We are registered 
officially, we pay taxes. But now we also took on additional work at 
night, as security guards.” 
A shortage of school openings for Ukrainian children led the Polish 
government to allow classes taught in Ukrainian, which created jobs for 
Ukrainian refugees with experience in education. There is also work for 
“support teachers” hired in classes taught in Polish but with Ukrainian 
children. But many Ukrainian refugees have trouble finding employ­
ment that corresponds to their skills (see Fig. 1)."
"Sometimes, the refugees don’t know how to apply for jobs for which

they are qualified. One 53-year old respondent explained, ‘All Ukrai­
nians who come here expect that they will have to work some hard, dirty 
work because they do not know the language, they do not know what to 
do and they are confused. My friend … translated [my CV] into Polish… 
After a while, I also got a call from a company which offered me a job 
with refugees because I had also worked as a journalist for many years.’ 
Another important issue, finding childcare for younger children, has 
also proven to be an obstacle to entering the job market and sometimes 
leads Ukrainians to consider returning home. A 29-year old Ukrainian 
woman told us, “‘The reason I'm not staying here [in Poland] is work. I 
am here alone with my son.... If I had a mother, a sister, or at least a 
husband here, I would know that he was under supervision…” 
2.2. The response in Germany 
According to the UNHCR data portal, Germany is hosting just over 
one million Ukrainian refugees, the second largest population of 
Ukrainian displaced persons. Of this million, 815,134 had registered for 
Temporary Protection status as of November 2022, which entitled them 
to social benefits, medical care and accommodation, as well as access to 
schools, the labor market and integration courses (Düvell, 2022). TP 
status is valid for 1 year but can be extended for up to 3 years. German 
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser stated in October that 70 % of adult ar­
rivals were women, and one third were teenagers and children. Finding 
enough housing for everyone has proved to be a challenge (Grieshaber, 
2022)."
"Like Poland, Germany experienced a surge of arrivals in early March 
and April 2022. Many reported that they had not prepared to flee and 
had to be persuaded to go by family members or men who were staying 
to fight. A 72-year-old woman who had arrived in Germany described 
what had happened in her family as follows: “He [my son] joined the 
territorial defense. He came and told us, ‘pack up and run away!’ I 
started to cry. Where to? My daughter and I really didn't want to go. We 
don't know anything there.” Because Germany does not share a border 
with Ukraine, the refugees arrived from Poland with a lag. Non- 
governmental organizations and individuals mobilized to meet Ukrai­
nian refugees at train stations and help them with translation, food, 
clothes, housing, medical and psychological services, legal assistance, 
and other support. As in Poland, civil society was first to respond, with 
state and local governments joining the effort later. As of June, Ukrai­
nians were eligible to receive monthly payments of around 400 Euros 
per person (DW, 2022) (see Table 4)."
"Given that they too were looking to find work quickly, as in Poland, 
Ukrainian refugees in Germany headed to the largest cities. Germany 
allocates each of its 16 states (lander) a quota for refugees, who are 
distributed across the country according to an algorithm that takes into 
account each state's population and tax revenue. Nonetheless, by 
September 2022, 12 of Germany's 16 states reported that they were at 
their breaking point (Glucroft, 2022)."
"Whereas the Polish government prioritized reimbursing receiving 
families, the German government provided benefits directed to dis­
placed Ukrainians, including free transportation and medical insurance, 
social housing (or subsidized rent), monthly welfare benefits of about 
450 euros and an additional payment for each child. Children are 
allowed – indeed obligated – to attend school though there are no na­
tional guidelines governing how they are placed. In some of Germany's 
16 states, children need to attend “welcome classes” before they can go 
to regular German schools. In others, they are placed in special prepa­
ratory classes for up to a year, while still others had the children start 
German school immediately. By December 2022, 201,000 Ukrainian 
children had been integrated into German schools, but demand still

"Note that questions on skills and jobs were not identical in the Polish and 
German surveys. We therefore report skills for the 330 respondents in Poland, 
and prior employment for the 390 respondents in Germany."

exceeded supply (Kinkartz, 2022) (see Fig. 2)."
"In both Poland and Germany, children thus become the main factor 
around which refugees' adaptation strategies are structured. Young 
women without children are also pulled into the problem of providing 
childcare. Many traveled as helpers or mediators with women who are 
distantly related, friends, or godchildren. Women leaving Ukraine often 
offered to take the children of family members or friends who were 
staying. A 35-year old woman in Germany recounted, “As they began 
shelling around Kyiv, I was afraid for [my] child. … I called [his] 
godfather to tell him that I am leaving tomorrow and l could take my 
god-child. She didn't want to go at first, but I came to them, we talked, 
consulted and she went with us. She is already 16 years old.” The ties 
between separated family members end up shaping women's strategies 
in the hosting countries. And once anchored by children, it will be more 
difficult for refugees to return home. Consider the perspective of a 42- 
year old Ukrainian mother in Germany, 
‘In this school, no one spoke Ukrainian or Russian. Russian was only 
spoken by 1-2 female teachers at the school, but they did not teach in 
the classroom. Today, my son speaks English fluently and he is 
starting to speak German so confidently. Therefore, I understand that 
this is a huge plus for his education. In March, my language course 
ends and I plan to return to Ukraine .... I plan to leave the little one 
here for a year so that he can learn German. …’ 
Those receiving temporary protection status are allowed to work but 
finding work has proven challenging for Ukrainian refugees in Germany."
"Those with inadequate German language proficiency must take six 
months of “integration” language courses, which delays their entrance 
to the job market. In the long term this may help the newly arrived gain 
the necessary language skills, but it is less efficient than the Polish sys­
tem which demands only that those who arrive register for a PESEL 
number before looking for work. A 42-year old woman explained that, 
‘Job prospects are such that if you want to work not in some simple 
job, such as a cashier in a supermarket or a cleaner… you need to 
have a language level of B-A, both English and German. …. That is 
also not easy. For example, I can only work part-time now…. because 
my language course starts at 1:45 p.m. and it takes me about 40 
minutes to get there. And the course lasts until 18:00.’ 
By October 2022, 51,000 Ukrainians had found jobs, 17,000 had 
part-time positions, and 423,000 had registered as looking for employ­
ment in Germany (German Federal Work Agency, 2022). Our survey 
suggests that the slow uptake of jobs is explained by the need to acquire 
language proficiency, slower bureaucracy, and the difficulty of placing 
children into kindergartens and schools. The option for female migrants 
to take a 34-hour “Migrant Women Simply Strong in Daily Life” class to 
practice their German and talk about their daily life (German Federal 
Office for Migration and Refugees, 2022) may seem far out of reach, as a 
41-year old mother explained. “I could not go to the courses, because I 
had no one to leave my children with. And we lived in such a village that 
there were no courses in our village, so we had to go 40 km away for 
these courses. And here's the thing, you understand that you can live in 
this village and adapt somehow, but you can't grow and develop 
somewhere.” 
Some Ukrainian refugees are not interested in acquiring the Tem­
porary Protection status that would allow them to receive benefits 
because it limits their ability to travel back to Ukraine. Germany re­
quires that TP migrants in Germany register in a specific state and mu­
nicipality; once they do it is very difficult to move, even within 
Germany. Someone who moves to a different municipality without 
permission cannot receive social welfare benefits. Thus, unregistered 
migrants who take advantage of the 90-day visa-free travel regime are 
more mobile but do not receive benefits."
"Though it is difficult to directly compare, it seems that Germans has 
been somewhat less receptive to Ukrainian migrants than Poles. Our 
June survey found that a quarter of respondents had experienced some 
discrimination from the local Russian-speaking diaspora, with only 5 % 
reporting hostility from other groups. As the war drags on, support for 
Ukrainian refugees across Europe may flag, driven partly by a Russian 
propaganda effort (Morris & Oremus, 2022). A quarterly survey of Eu­
ropean public opinion found that 77 % of Europeans are willing to 
accept Ukrainian refugees in their country though the number varies by 
country, with Spain being the most receptive and France the least 
(though still at 72 %). In Germany, readiness to accept Ukrainian refu­
gees has declined from 86 % in March to 74 % in September (Hoffman, 
2022)."
"2007 surveys in Europe revealed a high level of openly-expressed 
xenophobia towards refugees (Regional Representation for Central 
Europe & United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2008)."
"However contemporary surveys of European citizens show a markedly 
different attitude towards accepting refugees now compared to attitudes 
during previous refugee crises: only 3 % of Poles and 4 % of Germans 
surveyed state that Ukrainians should not be admitted to their countries."
"Compare that to the 13 % of Poles and 6 % of Germans who had said that 
no Syrian refugees should be allowed into their countries (Drazanova & 
Geddes, 2022). Ukrainians in Europe have, for the most part, been met in 
receiving countries with solidarity that is visibly higher than what was 
extended to previous waves of refugees."
"This may be partly explained by the cultural affinity of Europeans 
with Ukrainians, but it is also likely due to the fact that most of the 
Ukrainians arriving in Europe are women. Previous studies of civic 
engagement and social integration of refugees in Germany have shown 
that female refugees tend to be more engaged in a wide range of activ­
ities offered by receiving communities including leisure activities, lan­
guage lessons, sports and art lessons, and counseling on everyday issues."
"These activities not only help them legalize and receive social benefits 
faster, but also help create new social networks and practice of a new 
language through informal interactions (Barreto et al., 2022). The 
feminization of Ukrainian displacement may thus have created addi­
tional ground for solidarity and interaction with receiving communities."
"2.3. Ukrainian migration to Europe before 2014, and between 2014 and 
2022 
While the media has focused on the mass exodus and internal 
displacement of Ukrainians since Russia invaded in February 2022, 
Ukrainians have been actively moving within the Eurasian and Euro­
pean space for over a century (Fedyuk & Kindler, 2016). What has 
changed is the nature of this migration. Prior to 2014, migration from 
Ukraine was employment-driven. Estimates of the number of Ukrainians 
who worked abroad in the last two decades vary from 2 to 5 million 
based on populations surveyed and methodologies that attempt to 
calculate the number of workers missing from the local labor market 
(State Statistics Service of Ukraine (SSS), 2009; State Statistics Service of 
Ukraine (SSS), 2013). Surveys suggested that on average 70 % were 
male and most were married. Only one destination, Italy, was dominated 
by female labor migrants. A survey of female labor migrants in Italy 
found that only 6 % had no children; over 75 % had left one or two 
children in Ukraine, while 8 % had left three or more children behind 
(Malynovska et al., 2005). The same survey found that most migrants 
had completed secondary school or vocational training."
"2014 was a critical year in Ukrainian history. In February, Russian 
troops invaded and occupied Crimea. In April, Russia began supporting 
separatist movements in the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine, touching 
off a civil war that had claimed 14,000 lives by 2022. At least 2.8 million 
people were displaced according to a needs assessment conducted in 
Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts; 1.7 million people had registered as 
internally displaced, about one million had moved to Russia, and some 
100,000 moved to nearby countries where they registered as refugees or 
labor migrants (Vakhitova & Iavorskyi, 2020)."
"Russia had been the most popular destination for Ukrainian labor

migrants in 2012 but ceased to be after 2014 (Pienkowski, 2020). In 
contrast, political ties with EU strengthened. After the EU-Ukraine As­
sociation Agreement (AA) was signed and came into force, labor 
migration between Ukraine and Europe became easier."
"Receiving asylum in the EU remained very difficult, however. The 
number of Ukrainians applying for asylum in the EU was rather small, 
peaking at around 22,000 in 2015 (a 20-fold increase over 2013 
numbers) before falling to under 10,000 in the next three years (IOM, 
2019), and then dropping to just over 5000 in 2020 and 2021 as the 
conflict in Ukraine stabilized. Between 2013 and 2021, 16,100 Ukrai­
nians were granted asylum in EU member states. Importantly, across the 
EU, the share of female to male asylum seekers (47.4 % female vs 51.6 % 
male) increased relative to the proportion among labor migrants. In 
Germany, the ratio resembled the average (48.4 % female to 51.5 % 
male), whereas in Poland the ratio was slightly more skewed towards 
men at 43.7 % female vs 56.1 % male (Eurostat, 2022)."
"The number of Ukrainians applying for asylum in Europe before 
2022 was far less than the number of those traveling to Russia or Eu­
ropean countries for work. This was not, however, the narrative put 
forth by Polish and Hungarian politicians trying to rebuff European calls 
for them to accept more Syrian refugees. In 2016, for example, Polish 
Prime Minister Beata Szydlo rejected the refugee quota assigned by the 
EU, telling the European Parliament that Poland had taken instead ‘a 
million Ukrainian refugees.’ The real number was under ten (Dziennik 
Gazeta, 2016). Meanwhile, the number of residence permits issued to 
Ukrainians for employment skyrocketed from 387,000 in 2014 to 1.7 
million in 2017 (IOM Ukraine, 2019). Viktor Orban's government in 
Hungary solved a labor shortage by privileging Ukrainian labor migrants 
and then using them as an excuse not to accept Syrians (Pancevski, 
2019). Ukrainian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity even received Hun­
garian citizenship."
"In short, Ukrainians leaving their country before February 2022 were 
denied refugee status and pushed towards labor migration, which makes 
it difficult to categorize refugees as war-driven or labor-driven. Indeed, 
Vang argues that a “refugee is a ‘compositional subject’ whose critical 
position against the violence of colonialism and war, state government 
and national belonging is configured through these very domains of 
power” (Vang et al., 2016). However, it is important to note that the link 
between the wave of migration from Ukraine after 2014 and the war 
was, in public opinion, quite clear; mass emigration to Poland simply did 
not exist earlier. As in the cases of emigration waves from Syria and 
North Africa, it is difficult to assert that we can determine the primary 
motive driving mass migration."
"Among labor migrants in Europe, Ukrainians became a dominant 
nationality. In 2013, 14 % of the 1.63 million first-time resident permits 
issued in EU countries were issued to Ukrainians; in 2021, 30 %, or 
856,000, permits went to Ukrainians. (The next most prominent group 
was Moroccans, who claimed only 5 % of permits). Eurostat (2022) data 
indicate that Ukrainians received the most residence permits of any 
national group in Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, 
Estonia, and Denmark (but not in Germany). Before the war in February 
2022, Germany listed roughly 156,000 Ukrainians in the Central Reg­
ister of Foreigners (AZR); 48 % were women, 8000 said they were un­
employed, and another 20,000 registered as job-seekers."
"Both Poland (in 2018) and Germany (in 2020) liberalized employ­
ment and legalization procedures, extended temporary residence per­
mits, and signed bilateral social security agreements with Ukraine. Both 
Poland and Germany sought to attract Ukrainian workers but fewer 
Ukrainians worked in Germany than in Poland; Germany is farther away 
and the Polish language is close to Ukrainian and was easier for labor 
migrants to acquire. As a result, Poland became the primary EU desti­
nation for Ukrainian temporary workers, students, and permanent labor 
migrants. The estimated number of Ukrainian migrants in Poland almost 
tripled, reaching 507,000 in 2017 (Vakhitova & Fihel, 2020). According 
to a survey conducted in 2018 among Ukrainian migrants in Poland, 
over 70 % of those surveyed held different types of long-term permits, 
and only 4.2 % claimed they were undocumented (Mikheieva & Susak, 
2019). Before the war the Polish Central Statistical Office estimated that 
there were 1.35 million Ukrainians working in the country (Duszczyk & 
Kaczmarczyk, 2022). Most were from Western Ukraine (48 %) or the 
center of the country (31 %, including 6 % from Kyiv). Only 16 % were 
from southern Ukraine and 5 % from the east."
"Germany also lagged in welcoming Ukrainian labor migrants 
because its legislative regime was less permissive than those of other 
countries. Poland courted Ukrainian workers beginning in 2008 when it 
allowed Ukrainians to work for up to 6 months per calendar year 
without an employment permit as long as an employer sponsored the 
worker. Germany relaxed barriers to accessing its labor market only in 
2020 when the Skilled Immigration Act came into force (Khrebet, 2020)."
"Moreover, the Ukrainian workers going to Germany were different from 
those heading to Poland; a 2012 survey found that 90 % of those who 
had worked in the former had higher education, compared to 12 % of 
those who had worked in Poland (Libanova, 2013)."
"The increasing number of Ukrainian labor migrants in the EU in 
general combined with the liberalization of employment regulations, 
created a new Ukrainian diaspora. This diaspora actively participated in 
the accommodation of Ukrainian refugees in after 2014, and was even 
more supportive after Russia's full scale aggression (Düvell & Lapshyna, 
2022; Duszczyk & Kaczmarczyk, 2022). This Ukrainian diaspora, 
together with local activists and volunteers, became the primary source 
of support for Ukrainian refugees after February 24, 2022. Respondents 
to our survey in Germany reported that upon arrival they were offered 
help by different groups. Over 60 % reported receiving assistance from 
Ukrainian and German volunteers or self-aid groups. 55 % reported also 
having been helped by Germans they knew (friends, colleagues, or rel­
atives). Respondents in Poland were asked if they knew local people who 
could help them (see Table 5)."
"Nonetheless, a survey by the National Bank of Poland between April 
and May 2022 found that most Ukrainians arriving in Poland had not 
been there before. About 14 % of the respondents had worked in Poland 
before but 28 % said that family members had been employed in Poland 
before and were thus able to orient them to the country. 12 % had 
friends who had been there. The National Bank report concluded, “an 
important fact is that for more than 50% of the refugees who came to 
Poland displaced by the war, it was a completely new experience, un­
known from both personal experiences and from the accounts of rela­
tives and friends.” The degree to which respondents had friends or 
family with knowledge of Poland varied depending on which part of 
Ukraine the refugees had called home (National Bank of Poland, 2022)."
"Before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in February, it was 
primarily residents of Crimea and the Donbas that were displaced. After 
February 2022, military hostilities forced people from central and

eastern Ukraine to flee (see Fig. 3). Whereas Ukrainians in the western 
part of the country had considerable experience in moving back and 
forth to European countries to work, those from central and eastern 
regions had been less involved in cross-border labor migration and 
movement, and had much less experience crossing the border into other 
countries. For them, the need to leave suddenly came as a shock (see 
Fig. 3)."
"The western part of Ukraine sent proportionately more female 
workers than the south (46 % vs. 42 %) or the eastern part of the country 
(41 %). This difference reflected the difference in the sectors to which 
the regional populations gravitated. The West provided more workers 
for domestic or public service jobs proportionally. In contrast, the South 
and East of Ukraine sent migrants to work in industry, transport, con­
struction, and IT, which tend to be male-dominated (Mikheeva & Susak, 
2019)."
"However receptive both Polish and German societies have been to­
wards displaced Ukrainians, we cannot overlook the darker side of 
feminized migration. Young women traveling alone or with children are 
a vulnerable group exposed to the risk of trafficking and exploitation."
"There have been reports pointing to cases of abuse (Bauer-Babef, 2022; 
Pertek et al., 2022) but among our respondents, interlocutors testified 
that they were suffering from war-related trauma (mostly psychological) 
and had not had the bandwidth to pay attention to their security while 
traveling or even settling with private hosts. None of our respondents 
spoke of sexual abuse experienced while migrating, but they may have 
been inhibited by a fear of disclosure or bias; some did mention that they 
had been threatened with sexual abuse by Russian soldiers while still in 
Ukraine. In Poland, respondents stressed that Temporary Protection 
Status was not a solution to enforced dependency situations in which 
they found themselves. Many complained about labor exploitation and 
poor working conditions. Given that the Polish government recently 
terminated the program that provided displaced Ukrainians with 
financial support accommodations, this aspect of the situation calls for 
additional research and monitoring."
"3. Conclusions 
This paper has tried to describe the scale and nature of the Ukrainian 
refugee migration since February 24, 2022. The toll of war on Ukraine, 
on those still in Ukraine, and on those who have left the country has yet 
to be fully understood. What is clear from our research is that those who 
have arrived in Poland and Germany are both fortunate to have escaped 
immediate danger, and are confronting tremendous personal, profes­
sional, financial and familial challenges. A 28-year old woman from 
Kryvyi Rih explained during an interview in Poland: 
I am very worried about what may happen not only to the city but 
also to my parents. Now I am worried because me and my child are 
safe, but my parents and friends are not. Almost all my friends, co- 
workers, and everyone I communicated with stayed in Ukraine. I 
have a guilty conscience that they are there, and I am here."
"For decades scholars have tried to adapt migration theory to 
globalization-driven changes in how people move from one country to 
another, and even back and forth (Castles, 2002) but circular migration 
is difficult to capture in research. Even more unusual are situations like 
what we observe in Poland and Germany, where circular or pendular 
migration sets the stage for subsequent refugee movements– and then 
continues as some migrants forsake anchoring practices in their 
receiving country to preserve the flexibility to return home at will."
"Our research suggests couple of important features of the wave of 
Ukrainian refugees breaking across Europe since February 2022: 
First, this new wave of migration is overwhelmingly female. The 
literature on “feminized forced migration” is usually conceptualized as 
“the result of violence or [...] an act of opposition to violence at the 
intersection of various regimes” (Parson, 2010; Urba´
nska, 2016). This 
definition focuses on the issue of feminized forced migration in the 
realm of an individualized relationship to violence. It overlooks other 
dimensions, including situational conditions or events that leave a mark 
on the biographies of broader groups. As we consider the experience of 
Ukrainian refugees, it is clear that we need to reframe the concept of 
feminized forced migration to include migration driven by collective 
events like war and other forms of group violence. Wartime-forced 
migration is significantly different from migration described in the 
context of individual or structural-legal conditions. In a sense, the self- 
consciousness of forced migrants creates a mass situational context, it 
triggers a social process that changes women. The dynamics of this 
process are also influenced by the fluctuating nature of the stay in exile, 
linked to departure and return."
"Second, refugees from Ukraine are traveling in groups with children, 
which have an important impact on their concerns and decision-making."
"Before the war, labor migrants usually left their children behind and 
traveled alone to another country for work. Now the women take their 
children with them and leave their husbands behind. Almost all the 
refugees interviewed in depth had one or more children with them."
"Many said that they only left Ukraine to keep their children safe. When 
Russian aggression against Ukraine began in 2014, some families moved 
only their children because they couldn’t afford to move the entire 
family (Mikheieva & Sereda, 2015). Now those who leave have been 
taking the most vulnerable family members out of the country – chil­
dren, older people, or those who need medical care. People who 
completed our surveys in Poland and Germany usually traveled in 
groups of two and sometimes three generations, which affects what they 
needed to arrange before they can enter the job market. One-third of 
respondents focused on enrolling their children in school upon arrival."

placement may even be forced to return to Ukraine."
"Third, Ukrainian migration patterns before Russia's full-scale inva­
sion of February 2022 have influenced choices and patterns of migration 
after 2022. The mostly-male migrants from Ukraine before the war 
created networks and experiences that were important to the mostly- 
female migrants arriving in Poland and Germany after February 2022."
"Our survey found that many Ukrainian war refugees arriving in Poland 
knew not only “someone from Ukraine who is already here” (44 %) but 
also Poles (43 %)."
"There are, however, critical differences between what we see now 
and Ukrainian migration to Europe before Russia's full scale invasion of 
February 2022. Around three-quarters of Ukrainians in Europe are 
women (United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, 2022), 
and many are traveling with children and without husbands or elderly 
parents. They face an acute need for childcare, school, and work, all 
while trying to keep open the possibility of regularly traveling back to 
Ukraine to check on relatives. This tension often determines whether or 
not they apply for temporary protection or asylum status that could 
“lock” them in place outside of Ukraine."
"Fourth, Ukrainian refugees have been driven from Ukraine by war, 
but many want to regularly go back home from time to time. Because 
men aged 18–60 are not allowed to leave Ukraine, the women who have 
left feel the need to return to check on them, or their houses, or elderly 
relatives as soon as they have set up their children and traveling groups 
in the destination country in Europe. The movement of Ukrainians back 
and forth over the border is one of the unique features of this migration 
crisis. After Russia pulled its troops back from north and northeast 
Ukraine in May 2022, the frontline stabilized and migration into Ukraine 
became almost as common as migration out of Ukraine. The pattern of 
moving back and forth across the Ukrainian border tracks with labor 
migration patterns before 2022, when Ukrainian labor migrants would 
work in Europe for a few months and then return home before restarting 
the cycle. Pendulum labor migration was particularly common among 
female caregivers who worked during their 90-day visa-free stay in the 
EU and then returned to their families for 90 days."
"Practically all our interlocutors declared they are willing to return to 
Ukraine, but only under certain conditions. Many stressed that without 
peace and renovated infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, and 
apartments), it would be challenging to return, especially with children."
"These respondents are now planning longer stays in Poland or Germany 
and were willing to overcome the challenges of emigration for their 
children's safety and future. A 34-year old Ukrainian woman in Poland 
explained, 
We want these [Russian] orcs to be forced from our land and for us to 
return home in peace and live our normal lives. But what we are 
seeing now will be for a long time. There will be offensives, and 
counterattacks. They will occupy the territory. …I am afraid that 
many more people, houses, schools, and hospitals will be affected … 
Already half of Kharkiv is simply destroyed. My grandmother was 
left homeless because her house was on the outskirts of the city."
"Artillery worked there every half hour and there … Horror. I think it 
will still take a long time."
"The research described above reflects the first year of the war when 
migrants left Ukraine en masse and tried to adapt to new circumstances 
in Europe. How long the war lasts will determine whether refugees 
decide to settle in Poland, Germany, or other receiving countries, if only 
to avoid relocating their children again. Refugees who try to integrate 
themselves into society in a new country will face additional challenges, 
particularly since most of them have left family members at home – 
though this time, it is the husbands, not the children, who have 
remained behind in Ukraine (Polish Economic Institute, 2022: 36). As 
the war drags on, the needs of refugees will change, and require that 
receiving societies adapt. A senior official at a Polish bank hosted five 
Ukrainian refugees at his home in Poland and said, “They need 
employment, a stable income, free education, and free access to health 
and public services to create a new life in Poland” (Fusiek, 2022). Even 
as they dream of returning home to Ukraine."
