The Russian- Ukraine War has and further influence the global energy and food security. However, the detailed 
influence degree, key weak points and influence process is still unclear in the current. Therefore, this study 
established a newly improved under-load cascading failure model with consideration of overload limitation, and 
used it to evaluate influence of Russian- Ukraine War on the global energy and food security. This study also 
proposed a method to assess the network structure characteristic including robustness and resilience through 
model simulation under different scenarios. The main results include: The upper limitation of node load has the 
dominant function on the global energy and food security, while the influence of lower limitation parameter of 
node load has limited function. All of the networks have relative consistent recover and anti-damage ability 
against Russian and Ukraine War and the global panic except barley network. A key phenomenon we should 
concern is that the largest trade flow amounts are not occurred in the failure nodes. The failure nodes are always 
the countries with low economic scale and political status. The results tell us that we should further strengthen 
the importance of enhance production ability and energy types to resist the risk of Russian and Ukraine War. The 
global international organizations are also required to strengthen the function of balance the global security 
demand of energy and food between big countries and small countries. We should pay more attention to the little 
countries in the Africa and Asia to handle the risk."
"1. Introduction 
The world is in a fragile state under the long-term pressure from the 
COVID-19 pandemic in each field such as energy and food (Kruczkie­
wicz et al., 2021). The Russian invasion of Ukraine, occurred between 
two main exporters of food and energy in the world would even worsen 
the global energy and food security (Mbah and Wasum, 2022). The 
Russia-Ukraine War (RUW) has actually induced roaring cereal and oil 
prices, and global inflation (Deng et al., 2022). Tollefson (2022) 
believed that although RUW has caused a short-term prices increase, it 
would be a chance to prompt a long-term shift towards energy 
sustainability."
"Many academics, government officials and journalists have discussed 
the influence of RUW on energy and food security (Benton et al., 2022)."
"However, they are mainly discussed based on expert judgment, without 
a suitable model analysis tool. The influence of RUW on energy and food 
are mostly explored in the regional level such as European Union 
(Blanchard and Pisani-Ferry., 2022), Morocc (Mengoub et al., 2022), 
Indian (Meena, 2022), Azerbaijan (Mammadov, 2022), China (Oxford 
Analytica, 2022a), Japan (Oxford Analytica, 2022b)."
"In the context of economic globalization, the supply and demand of 
food and energy between each country are closed linked (D’Odorico 
et al., 2018; Ruhl., 2019 Gaupp, 2020). The regional element corruption 
would cause global disaster in the complex network, which is called 
cascading failures (Lee and Goh., 2016). The cascading failures process 
has been revealed in the networks such as physical infrastructure net­
works (Guo et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2021), economic and finance network 
(Havlin and Kenett., 2015; Smolyak et al., 2018), and internet network

(Xing, 2020; Ren et al., 2018). Take the economic trade network as an 
example, the cascading failures process can be described as below: Once 
a country has a supply or demand problem of a product, then a global 
cascading failure is triggered in the trade network due to the global 
economic trade relationship. The cascading failures types including 
edge-based-attack cascading failures and node-based-attack cascading 
failures (Li et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2014). The simple occurrence 
mechanism is that under the initial attack, the load of the attacked node 
or edge would be distributed to its neighbors, and once the load of 
neighbors is larger compared with their load capacity, the neighbors are 
destroyed, and finally caused network cascading failure (Zhao et al., 
2016). In some cases such as supply chain networks, the underload 
cascading failures process would be considered, which indicates that 
under the initial attack, due to lack of the load supply of the targeted 
node or edge, the load of the neighbors is reduced and once lower with 
the underload capacity, the neighbors are destroyed, and finally caused 
network cascading failure (Yang et al., 2021)."
"However, the cascading failures method is still few used in the 
research of global food or energy trade system, let alone the coupled 
food-energy system. The current cascading failures analysis barely 
consider the overload status and underload status at the same time. In 
the single food trade system, the lack of a main food exporter country 
would not cause food security risk of targeted importer countries, the 
food security risk of targeted importer countries would induce second­
ary food risk of other countries. So as the single energy trade system."
"What’s more, due to the economic globalization, the basic primary 
industry-food system, and the basic secondary industry-energy system 
also have closed linkages, and have key influence on the whole eco­
nomic system of a certain country. One system breakdown would cause 
the disruption of the other system. The cascading failures method is also 
a suitable tool to assess the influence of war on the global energy and 
food trade systems, which is still few can be found in the current 
research."
"Academics have agreed that RUW would cause global food and en­
ergy crisis (Benton et al., 2022; Osendarp et al., 2022; ˙
Zuk and ˙
Zuk, 
2022). However, there is still limited understanding of how RUW would 
influence the global energy and food security and ways to design an 
alternative means to mitigate the influence. To help address this gap, we 
construct a global energy and food network that includes approximately 
238 countries, three main types of energy and three main types of ce­
reals, so as the coupled energy and food networks. We create and 
improve an underload cascading failure with consideration of overload 
limitation to assess the influence of RUW on the global energy and food 
security. To fill the existing gap between knowledge and practice on this 
topic, a scenario analysis is also used to reveal the global energy and 
food security risks due to RUW through comparing different capacity 
and load change and coupling modes to answer some important ques­
tions: What would RUW bring to the global energy and food security? 
What is the cascading failure process caused by RUW? Which are the key 
and vulnerable countries that would be hurt by RUW? What are the best 
means to mitigate the influence of RUW? Our findings offer significant 
new insights that can reveal the impact degree of RUW and enable 
policymakers to identify potential solutions to this global crisis."
"2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Global Network Data 
According to the UN Comtrade Database, complex trade networks of 
energy and food covering all import and export flows occurring between 
238 countries in 2020 have been developed. We downloaded data on 
“cereals” and “fossil fuels” on May 1st, 2020. To avoid double counting 
between exporter and importer, which named reporter and partner in 
the UN Comtrade Database, the information on the importers is 
extracted as import data are usually more accurate (Shi et al., 2021)."
"Furthermore, in the energy trade network, the more specific energy 
types of coal, oil and gas are chosen to reveal their cascading failure 
process. In the food trade network, only the cereals are considered, 
especially barley, maize and wheat. The energy trade network and food 
trade network are integrated according to the energy equivalent 
(Tiewsoh et al., 2017) 
2.2. Improved Cascading Failure Model 
There are two basic cascading failure modes, one is overload 
cascading failure, which is often used in infrastructure networks, and the 
other one is under-load cascading failure, which is used in supply net­
works. A complex network usually considers one kind of cascading 
failure mode at the same time. The initial load, the capacity, the dis­
tribution rule, and the failure rule are the four basic components of a 
cascading failure model of a complex network (Wang et al., 2018). This 
study establishes a newly improved under-load cascading failure model 
with consideration of overload limitation (OLUCF). The main 
improvement is that the model considers the under-load limitation and 
overload limitation at the same time. However, different from the 
existed cascading failure model, the overload limitation would not 
induce nodes failure, the main function of overload limitation is that the 
surplus load compared with the overload capacity would be canceled."
"Only the actual load is lower than the under-load limitation, then the 
cascading failure process will be stimulated. The reason is that in the real 
energy and food systems, each country has its upper-limitation of pro­
duction and consumption, once the actual load exceeds the 
upper-limitation, they have trade amount self-adjustment ability when 
the load is too high rather than destroy themselves. However, under the 
background of economic globalization, once the actual load is lower 
than the lower-limitation requirement, as the basic supply sector in the 
economy system, the lack of the adequate energy and food will destroy 
the country economy, and cause the cascading failure process."
"In the OLUCF, only the loads of nodes are considered in the initial 
load and capacity determination firstly. Then, to simulate the influence 
of RUW, the nodes of Russian and Ukraine will be disrupted. During the 
load distribution process, both the loads of nodes and edges will be 
considered. During the distribution process, the export amount from 
Russian or Ukraine will be distributed to other edges from other exporter 
countries which has trade relationship with the targeted importer 
country according to their initial loads proportionally. Furthermore, the 
upper-limitation of node load capacity will be assigned to each edge 
according to their initial loads proportionally. Once an edge’s load ex­
ceeds its upper-limitation, the surplus amount will be distributed to 
other edges from other countries which has trade relationship with the 
targeted importer country. Then, subsequent overloads may occur."
"Finally, after all the surplus capacity of other available nodes are 
distributed, the undistributable trade amount will be deleted directly."
"Then the failure rule may be triggered by the failed nodes, while the 
export amount of export country or import amount of import country is 
less than the minimum capacities, are forbidden from importing or 
exporting food or energy. The dynamic progression of the OLUCF is 
illustrated in Fig. 1."
"In the step1, we use the export amounts of countries to measure the 
initial load. The capacity of each country has upper and lower limits."

In which, NCi(max) indicates the upper limit of node i, NCi(min) in­
dicates the lower limit of node i, L0i indicates the initial load of node i, 
Exporti indicates the export amount of food or energy of node i, Importi 
indicates the import amount of food or energy of node i, α indicates the 
fixed upper limit parameter, β indicates the fixed lower limit parameter."

In the step 2 and step 3, once Russian and Ukraine are disrupted, the 
export amount from them will be distributed to other edges from other 
exporter countries which has trade relationship with the targeted 
importer country according to their initial loads proportionally."

ing to their initial loads proportionally."

"Finally, after all the surplus capacity of other available nodes are 
distributed, the undistributable trade amount will be deleted directly."
"Then if the export amount of export country or import amount of import 
country m in the energy or food network is lower than the lower limi­
tation of node m, the failure rule will be triggered by the failed nodes m, 
which are forbidden from importing or exporting food or energy."
"To further reveal the possible coupling relationship between energy 
and cereals network, and its influence on global energy and cereals 
network. The coupling parameter between energy and food networks is 
proposed, and simulated in OLUCF. It indicates that for the same 
country, if its node load in the energy or food network is lower than the 
limitation of the coupling value, then, the node in the other network 
would be destroyed, no matter what the current node load is. It can be 
recognized a new way to simulate cascading failure in the interdepen­
dent networks with consideration of the simple relationship of symbiotic 
relationship, which is different from the previous method that focus on 
the edges establishment and weight calculation."
"In addition, this study proposed a method to assess the network 
structure characteristic including robustness and resilience, through 
OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. The network robustness 
strength means the ability to maintain its structure against RUW, which 
is assessed through the following formula: 
NRO = NENα=1
TN
, α = 1
(9) 
In which, NENα=1 indicates the effective nodes number in the 
network after cascading failure simulation which α is set as 1, TN in­
dicates the total nodes number in the network, NRO indicates the 
network robustness strength."
"The network resilience assessment including the resilience with only 
consideration of the upper limitation increase of node load induced by 
direct influence of RUW (NREd)and the resilience with consideration of 
the upper limitation decrease of node load and node load increase 
induced by the indirect influence from global panic of RUW (NREin)."
"NREd indicates the recover ability of the network against RUW, and 
NREind indicates the anti-damage ability against RUW and global panic."

In which, NENα=a indicates the effective nodes number in the 
network after cascading failure simulation which α is set as a, NENα=b 
indicates the effective nodes number in the network after cascading 
failure simulation which α is set as b. The higher value of NREd and 
NREind indicates the better resilience against RUW and the global panic."
"The α value is obtained from the node load change ratio in the real 
network. In this study, in order to exclude the impact of COVID-19, the 
actual historical trade change trend from the most recent years of 2018- 
2019 is adopted, we can find that most of the change ratio compared 
with the current node load are in the range of 0.5-1.5, which is 
accounted for 71.90% at least (table 1). Therefore, the value of α is set as 
1.5 to calculate NREd and is set as 0.5 to calculate NREind. Researchers 
can adopt their suitable α value according to their research requirement."
"2.3. Scenarios design 
To observe the possible risk of RUW on the global food and energy 
security, four types of cascading failure modes are simulated with 
different node load and capacity change rules, and network coupling 
rules (table 2). The scenarios are set according to the parameters chosen 
and value assignment. Furthermore, in the energy trade network, the 
more specific energy types of coal, oil and gas are chosen to reveal their 
cascading failure process. In the food trade network, only the cereals are 
considered, especially barley, maize and wheat."
"The node load indicates the total energy or food exports amount of a 
country. The upper limitation of node load is assumed to be related with 
the node load, it will increase 0 %-50% compared with current node load 
in the upper limitation increase scenario and decrease 0 %-50% 
compared with current node load in Load increase-Upper limitation 
decrease scenario. Coupling parameter between food and energy 
network. To identify the influence of coupling effect between energy and 
food network on the global energy and food security, we assumed that 
for the same country, if its node load in the energy or food network is 
lower than the limitation of the coupling value, then, the node in the 
other network would be destroyed, no matter what the current node 
load is. Therefore, it should be a low value which indicates that the 
coupling cascading failure process is not easy happened in the interde­
pendent network. Therefore, the change range of the coupling param­
eter is set between 0-0.4. Lower limitation of node load is a key 
parameter that induced the cascading failure process in this process. It is 
also the main improvement of OLUCF compared with the existed 
cascading failure mode. Only the actual node load is lower than the 
under-load limitation, then the cascading failure process will be stimu­
lated which is more in line with reality. Once the actual load is lower 
than the lower-limitation requirement, as the basic supply sector in the 
economy system, the lack of the adequate energy and food will destroy 
the country economy, and cause the cascading failure process. The 
change range of the lower limitation of node load is set between 0.1-0.6."
"To observe the critical threshold of the influence of each parameter on 
the global energy and food network, the parameters value is set as a 
series of number in a certain range. Then, the cascading failure results 
with each parameters value combination can be obtained. The critical 
threshold value can provide suggestions for risk identification and pre­
vention of global energy and food security."
"The first two scenarios are simulated in all of energy network 
including coal, oil, gas, and the integrated energy network, and food 
network including barley, maize, wheat and the integrated cereals 
network. In the first scenario of upper limitation increase of node load, 
we will observe the influence change of RUW on the global food and 
energy security along with the countries’ production ability increase and 
the ability to resist risk of import and export ratio decrease. The pro­
duction ability increase can be presented by the parameter value in­
crease of upper limitation of node load, and the ability to resist risk of 
import and export ratio decrease can be indicated by the parameter 
value increase of the lower limitation of node load. The second scenario 
of load increase and upper limitation decrease is established based on 
the assumption that to prevent the hurt of global panic induced by the 
RUW on the local food and energy security, the import country would 
increase their import demand, and the export country would decrease 
their exporter demand. The difference compared with the first scenario 
is that the parameter of node load increases 
The last two scenarios are only simulated in the integrated energy 
and cereals network, which assumed that the node failure in the inte­
grated energy or cereals network would induce the node failure in the 
other network, which can be recognized as cascading failure in inter­
dependent networks (Duan et al., 2019). In this study the cascading 
failure process in interdependent networks happened through the 
coupling parameters of food and energy networks. The third scenario is 
based on the first scenario with consideration of the coupling process 
between food and energy networks. The fourth scenario is based on the 
second scenario with consideration of the coupling process between 
food and energy networks. The coupling effect is presented by the value 
of coupling parameter between food and energy network. The higher of 
the value, the easier happen of the coupling cascading failure process in 
the interdependent networks."
"3. Results and Discussion 
3.1. Global energy and cereals contribution of Russian and Ukraine 
It can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 12.09% to the 
global energy trade, while Russian accounted for 12.01%. Fig. 2 shown 
that the countries with highest imports percentage from Russian were 
mostly located in the Europe and Asia. It also indicates that they may 
more easily been influenced by RUW. Focusing on specific energy types, 
it can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 15.60% to the 
global coal trade, 11.34% to the global oil trade and 10.00% to the 
global gas trade, while Russian accounted most of the export amount."
"In the global cereals trade network, the pattern is quite different from 
the energy network. It can be found that Russian and Ukraine contrib­
utes 18.83 % to the global cereals trade, while Russian and Ukraine 
nearly accounted for the same ratio. Fig. 2 shown that the countries with 
highest imports percentage from Russian and Ukraine were mostly 
located in the Africa, Europe and Asia. It also indicates that they may 
more easily been influenced by RUW. Focusing on specific cereals types, 
it can be found that Russian and Ukraine contributes 19.55% to the 
global barley trade, 14.44% to the global maize trade and 10.00% to the 
global wheat trade, while Russian accounted most of the export amount."
"While for barley, the nearly accounted for the same ratio, for maize, 
Ukraine accounted most of the contribution, and for wheat, Russian 
accounted for the 66.66% among the contribution of them."
"From the view of exports countries of cereals and energy from 
Russian and Ukraine, it can be found that they are mostly of the coun­
tries with relative lower economy scale. The export amounts of energy 
only accounted for 6.30% of the total imports amount of the United 
States, and 12.68 in China, which are mainly come from Russian. While 
for cereals, they only accounted for 0.17% in the United States and 23.11 
% in China, which are mainly come from Ukraine."
"3.2. Influence of RUW on global energy security 
Influence of RUW on global energy trade network can be found 
through OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. While LLNL is

determined, it can be found that along with the increase of upper- lim­
itation of node load, the number of retained countries become more."
"Once the upper-limitation increase to 120% of the current node load, all 
of the four types of energy network would maintain 80% of the coun­
tries. The integrated energy network and oil trade network have the 
strongest robustness against RUW, they can maintain more than 80% of 
the countries, even though other countries have no extra production 
ability. while coal trade network is more easily influenced by RUW, once 
other countries have no extra coal production ability, only 42.92% of the 
countries are left in the network. Furthermore, the existed countries 
number of integrated energy network, oil trade network and gas 
network would recover to 94.12%, 93.67% and 80.70% while ULNL 
increase to 105%, and it requires ULNL increase to 115% to maintain the 
existed countries number of coal network at a high level. Therefore, 
RUW have more influence on coal and gas trade network than oil 
network. Through the separate simulation of node failure of Russian and 
Ukraine, it can be found that it is Russian that mainly influence the 
global energy trade network. Through observation of the influence 
change along with LLNL increase while ULNL is equal to 0.3, it can be 
found that due to the adequate upper limitation of node load, the LLNL 
change has little influence on global energy network. There is still more 
than 92.52% existed in the network under attacks. Among them, the gas 
and coal trade networks are more easily influenced by LLNL change, it 
indicates that the average exports amount percentages of gas and coal 
contributes from Russian are higher than oil and the integrated energy."
"Under the LIULDS, it can be found that RUW would produce much 
larger influence than their actual energy export amount due to ampli­
fication effect of energy demand and storage from fears of energy 
shortages. The integrated energy trade network and oil trade network 
presented their strong robustness against RUW that they can still 
maintain more than 40. 75% of the countries while the node load in­
crease to 50 %, the upper limitation of node load decrease to 50 %, and 
LLNL is equal to 0.4. The coal and gas network can only maintain 9.13 % 
and 3.95 % of the countries in the final. While ULNL is equal to 0.3, it 
can be found that the coal and gas trade network would be nearly 
destroyed dramatically, the effective countries of the integrated energy 
and oil trade network would be also reduced significantly, which only 
57.14 % and 61.18 % of the countries are maintained."
"Through comparison of Fig. 3a, 3b and 3c,3d, it can be concluded 
that the vulnerability of the gas trade network is the highest, once the 
network upper limitation is reduced and the node load increase, it will 
be easily influenced by RUW. However, it also has relative strong 
resilience, once the upper limitation of node load increase 5%, then the 
effective nodes ratio will increase from 55.70 % to 80.70 %. The 
parameter of upper limitation of node load has the dominant function on 
the global energy security, while the influence of lower limitation 
parameter of node load has limited function. Under ULIS, which is the 
optimistic and simple scenario, if all of the energy exporter countries 
own more than 15% surplus production ability, all of the four types of 
energy network can maintain at least 87.72% of the country nodes."
"However, under LIULDS, which can be recognized as the extreme situ­
ation caused by the global energy security, the global energy trade 
network can be hurt obviously, especially the coal and gas trade 
network. During RUW, the energy exports change of Russian plays the 
key role on the global energy trade network compared with Ukraine, 
which is consistent the results of the 3.1 section."
"3.3. Influence of RUW on global cereals security 
The Influence of RUW on global cereals trade network can be 
assessed through OLUCF simulation under different scenarios. While 
LLNL is set 0.4, the increase of upper-limitation of node load would 
recover the effective country nodes of the cereals network. Among the 
four types of cereals network, the integrated cereals network can recover 
most quickly following by maize trade network, while there are 20% 
surplus capacity of other countries, they can reserve 97. 47 % and 
92.00% of the total country nodes separately. The wheat trade network 
is influenced most significantly by RUW. Until there are 35% surplus 
capacity of other countries, it can reserve 91.73% effective country 
nodes. Specially, the influence of RUW on the barley trade network is 
limited, and have little recovery along with the increase of upper limi­
tation of node load, it indicates that in the barley trade network, the 
export destination countries from Russian and Ukraine is limited, so as 
the import sources diversity of the countries which import barley from 
Russian and Ukraine. Therefore, RUS can only destroy restricted country 
numbers, and these countries are not easy obtain barley from other 
countries. Russian has greater influence on wheat trade network, while 
Ukraine has greater influence on maize trade network. Through obser­
vation of the influence change along with LLNL increase while ULNL is 
equal to 0.3, it can be found that RUW has more obvious influence on the 
cereals network, especially the wheat trade network compared with the 
energy trade network. The cereals trade network requires more upper 
limitation of node loads in order to protect the network integrity 
compared with the energy trade network. What is more, RUW would 
induce the wheat supply of 20 % of the total countries less than 40 %."
"Fig. 4c presents some different results compared with the energy 
network. In the energy network, gas network is most significantly 
influenced by RUW under ULIS and LIULDS. In the cereals network, the 
wheat network shows its vulnerability and the barley network shows its 
robustness facing RUW under ULIS. However, under LIULDS, along with 
the upper limitation of node load decrease and node load increase, the 
barley network present opposite characteristic. The reason is that, the 
barley trade network is little relied on Russian and Ukraine and is 
strongly relied on other countries. The global scare of food shortage 
induced by RUW would change the upper limitation of food export 
amount, although RUW could not directly influence the global barley 
trade network. The indirect influence of RUS would significantly hurt 
the export amount from other countries, and finally lead to the collapse 
of barley network. The maize trade network has nearly the same char­
acteristic with the barley network, while the wheat network shows 
opposite characteristic that has relative vulnerability under ULIS and 
robustness under LIULDS. The integrated cereals networks maintain 
strong robustness under the two scenarios. The parameter of upper 
limitation of node load has the dominant function on the global cereals

has more obvious function compared with the energy trade network."
"3.4. Influence of RUW on global coupled energy and cereals security 
In the current coupling effect research of energy and food systems, 
they are mainly carried out from the area of water–energy–food nexus 
research based on the methods of integrated index, computable general 
equilibrium model, ecological network analysis, life-cycle analysis, 
input-output analysis, system dynamics model, agent-based modeling, 
etc (Endo et al., 2020). They can reveal overall status of coupled energy 
and food systems, and the linkage strength between energy and food 
systems. The coupling effect are revealed based on the indicators cor­
relation and flow amount. However, the cascading failure mode have

not been used in the coupled effect research of energy and food systems."
"OLUCF can reveal the robustness, resilience, and the ability to resist risk 
of the energy and food network, and can also identify the influence of a 
certain disaster on the energy and food network through simulated 
strike. The results can provide direct support for global energy and food 
security management. The coupling parameter is firstly proposed to 
observe the influence of coupling effect of energy and food systems on 
the global energy and food security. We assumed the possible coupling 
strength between energy and food networks, then, we observed that 
under the specific coupling parameter value, what would happen to the 
coupled energy and food networks, and the influence on the global en­
ergy and food security. The results can tell us what is the influence

extent that the coupling effect would bring to the global food and energy 
systems, the possible risky nodes and risk transfer path, and the critical 
risky threshold."
"To further reveal the possible coupling relationship between energy 
and cereals network, and its influence on global energy and cereals 
network. The coupling parameter between energy and cereals networks 
is proposed, and simulated in OLUCF. It can be found that under ULIS, 
while ULNL and LLNL is set as 0.3 and as 0.4 separately, the global 
energy and cereals networks has adequate potential to face the crisis of 
RUW, and the coupling parameter has nearly no influence on them."

Under LIULDS, the integrated energy and cereals network would have 
relative more reduction of the effective country nodes with consider­
ation of the coupling process compared with the scenarios without 
consideration of the coupling process. The effective country nodes in the 
integrated energy network would reduce from 69.75 % to 56. 30% while 
the coupling parameter value is set as 0.40, and the effective country 
nodes in the integrated cereals network would reduce from 54.43 % to 
51. 05% while the coupling parameter value is set as 0.40. The result 
indicates that although RUW has more significant influence on the ce­
reals network than energy network, the coupling parameter would 
enhance more influence RUW on energy network than cereals network."
"The more important point is that, under LIULDS, along with the stronger 
coupling strength between the energy and food network, the easier to be 
destroyed by the specific disaster. The critical threshold is 0.05, it in­
dicates that for the same country, if its node load in the energy or food 
network is lower than 0.05, then, the node in the other network would 
not be easily destroyed."
"3.5. Network Robustness and Resilience 
This study proposed a method to assess the network robustness and 
resilience characteristic against RUW under ULIS and LIULDS. Through 
observation of the bubble size of network in Fig. 5, it can be found that in 
the energy network, the integrated energy and oil network have the 
strong robustness against RUW, and in the food network, the cereals and 
barley network have the strong robustness against RUW. Through 
observation of NREd and NREind value, it can be found that the coal, 
cereals and wheat networks have the strong ability of recover and anti- 
damage against RUW and global panic, while gas and maize network 
have relative strong recover ability and low anti-damage ability. Totally, 
all of the networks have relative consistent recover and anti-damage 
ability against RUW and the global panic except barley network. The 
barley network has low recover ability and anti-damage ability."
"It can be also found that the there is no positive correlation between 
robustness and resilience. The strong robustness of barley network does 
not bring its strong resilience against RUW. It indicates that in the barley 
network, Russian and Ukraine have limited contribution to the global 
exports, and other main countries own the large ratio of global exports."
"The low robustness of coal network does not mean its low resilience 
ability. It indicates that Russian and Ukraine have dominant role in the 
global coal exports, however, the role can be easily replacement by other 
coal exports countries. For the network of the integrated energy and oil 
network, they have strong robustness, it indicates Russian and Ukraine 
have normal contribution to the global exports, at the same time, there 
are other countries with similar oil export scale that although they can 
not completely share the oil exports amount of Russian and Ukraine, 
they have the ability of anti-damage by RUW and the global panic. Fig. 6 
3.6. Typical influence process of RUW 
The typical influence process of RUW on the global energy and ce­
reals network are assessed while the upper limitation of node load is set 
as 0.3 and the lower limitation of node load is set as 0.4 under ULIS and 
LIULDS. Under ULIS, there’s no failure node in both of the energy and 
cereals network except Russian and Ukraine. The trade flow amounts 
have been changed a little, the total trade flow amount is reduced by 
1.05%, in the energy network, while in the cereals network, the total 
trade flow amount is reduced by 0.71%. However, the influenced 
countries nodes in the energy network are more concentrated, while it is 
more disperse in the cereals network. The trade relationship edges have 
been reduced from 10260 to 9832 in the energy network, while in the 
cereals network, it has been reduced from 8528 to 8113. Through 
observation of the trade flow pattern, it can be found that there is some 
difference between energy network and cereals network. Without 
consideration the political relationship, it can be found that RUW would 
cause the significant reduction of energy trade flow from Russian to 
China, so as the flow to Korea Republic, Netherlands, Germany, Italy and 
Japan, while these influenced countries would search for replacement, 
such as the flow increment from Indonesia, Australia and Saudi Arabia 
to China, Norway to Germany, Canada to United States, Nigeria to 
Turkey, etc. RUW would cause the obvious cereals trade reduction from 
Russian and Ukraine to Egypt, Russian to Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and 
Ukraine to Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia, Turkey and Korea Republic."
"Then, these influenced countries would search for replacement such as 
France, Romania, United States and Australia to Egypt, United States 
and Canada to China, etc."
"Considering the information of international relations order and 
geographical relationship, some more specific results we can obtain. The 
energy imports status of China may still maintain a normal level. The 
energy imports of Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Japan and Korea Re­
public would be vastly reduced. Especially, the long-term low-carbon 
energy transformation has decreased their dependency on the coal en­
ergy. At the same time, the clean energy ratio can not be increased in a 
short period, the limited land area in these countries has also restricted 
the potential of photovoltaic energy (Dupont et al., 2020). Therefore, 
there are three suggestions: Firstly, they should not only enhance the 
imports amount from the existed energy exports countries, the other 
newly energy trade relationship should be also established with other 
energy exports countries. Although, it would indicate higher trans­
portation cost. For the countries themselves, they should further develop 
suitable new energy resources such as nuclear energy, wind energy, etc."
"They may even re-enable coal-based thermal power plant to deal with 
the urgent energy security crisis, even though it would induce 
short-term carbon emission increment. Secondly, the obvious suggestion 
is that other energy exports countries should enhance the ability of en­
ergy exports to deal with the global energy crisis. Lastly, the RUW does 
not indicate the absolute reduction of energy exports from Russian and 
Ukraine. The countries which have good relationship with Russian can

10
support as transfer station for energy trade, such as China."
"For the food security, the food imports of Egypt, Turkey, Saudi 
Arabia, Spain, Netherlands, Indonesia, and Korea Republic would be 
vastly reduced. Similarly, they should not only enhance the imports 
amount from the existed food exports countries, the other newly food 
trade relationship should be also established with other food exports 
countries. Although, it would indicate higher transportation cost. The 
other food exports countries should enhance the ability of food exports 
to deal with the global crisis."
"Under the LIULDS with consideration the global panic, it can be 
found that, large ratio of countries nodes is destroyed or hurt, including 
72 countries nodes in the energy network and 108 countries nodes in the 
cereals network. Most of the failure nodes are the little countries without 
adequate concentration in the current media such as Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, Algeria, Libya, Oman, Tunisia in the Africa and Central Asian."
"There are also 1644 edges in the energy network and 3211 edges in the 
cereals network are destroyed. The energy trade flow edges with large 
reduction include edges from Canada to United States, from Russian, 
Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia to China, from Australia to Japan, etc. The 
edges with large increment include edges from Canada to Japan, Nigeria 
to United States, Canada and Nigeria to China, and United States to 
Turkey. In the cereals network, the trade flow amount of the main edges 
including from Russian to Egypt and Turkey, United States to Mexico 
and Japan, Ukraine and Canada to China are reduced. The partial results 
are consistent with the influence judgement of RUW on the Egypt and 
Turkey from Lang et al (2022) Fig. 7."
"A key phenomenon we should concern is that the largest trade flow 
amounts are not occurred in the failure nodes. The reason is that always 
the countries with large economic scale have more energy and food 
requirement, at the same time, they have more diversity of energy and 
cereals types and supply sources, and are more able to resist the risk of 
war. However, the failure nodes are always the countries with low 
economic scale and political status, they are unable to handle the risky 
caused by war, under the global panic, they do not have much more 
approaches to search for supply replacement of energy and cereals, and 
are more easily trapped in the crisis of energy and food shortages."
"4. Conclusions 
This study established an improved under-load cascading failure 
model, and can support for assessment of risky and influence process in 
the energy cereals network due to Russian and Ukraine War."
"4.1. Policy implication 
Based on the model simulation, we firstly can find that the impor­
tance of Russian and Ukraine on the global energy and cereals network."
"In the energy networks, the gas and coal trade networks are more 
significantly influenced by RUW than the oil network. In the cereals 
networks, RUW has more influence on wheat trade network. Totally, the 
cereals networks are more easily influenced by RUW than the energy 
networks."
"Through scenario simulation, it can be found that the parameter of 
upper limitation of node load has the dominant function on the global 
energy and food security, while the influence of lower limitation 
parameter of node load has limited function. It reminds us that we 
should keep reserved capacity of energy and cereals as more as possible 
to resist the risk such as war, global warm and epidemic. We can also 
find that the integrated energy and cereals network has more robustness 
and resilience compared with the single type of network. The results tell 
us the energy substitution is an effective way to handle the risk of RUW."
"The more diversity of energy types was developed, the more able to 
survival in the risky world."
"The lower limitation parameter of node load has limited influence on 
Fig. 6. Network Robustness and Resilience under ULIS and LIULDS. Note: the bubble size indicates the robustness strength of each network. The higher value of 
NREd and NREind indicates the better resilience against RUW and the global panic. The black lines with arrow indicate the average value of NREd and NREind of the 
eight networks."

the global energy and cereals network with only consideration of the 
direct influence of RUW. However, if the global panic of energy and food 
shortages caused by RUW are assessed in the simulation, it would induce 
the global disasters. Even the integrated energy and cereals trade 
network can only maintain nearly 40. 75% and 54.43 of the effective 
countries’ nodes. The results further strengthen the importance of 
enhance production ability and energy types to realize to resist the risk 
of RUW. The critical threshold of upper limitation and lower limitation 
of node load to protect global energy and food security is also obtained, 
totally we should try to maintain the export capability of the main 
exporting countries higher than 20 % to resist risky of RUW. With 
consideration of the global panic, we should try to maintain the export 
capability no less than 5%. The possible coupling relationship between 
energy and cereals network has limited influence on the global energy 
and cereals network with only consideration of the direct influence of 
RUW. Under LIULDS, the influence of the coupling effect on the energy 
and cereals network are amplified. What’s more, the result indicates that 
although RUW has more significant influence on the cereals network 
than energy network, the coupling parameter would enhance more in­
fluence RUW on energy network than cereals network."
"Through network characteristic comparison of robustness and resil­
ience, it can be found that the coal, cereals and wheat networks have the 
strong ability of recover and anti-damage against RUW and global panic, 
while gas and maize network have relative strong recover ability and 
low anti-damage ability. Totally, all of the networks have relative 
consistent recover and anti-damage ability against RUW and the global 
panic except barley network. The barley network has low recover ability 
and anti-damage ability. There is no positive correlation between 
robustness and resilience. The strong robustness of barley network does 
not bring its strong resilience against RUW. It indicates that in the barley 
network, Russian and Ukraine have limited contribution to the global 
exports, and other main countries own the large ratio of global exports."
"The low robustness of coal network does not mean its low resilience 
ability. It indicates that Russian and Ukraine have dominant role in the 
global coal exports, however, the role can be easily replacement by other 
coal exports countries."
"The detailed influence process of RUW on the global energy and 
cereal network can be also revealed through the OLUCF established in 
this study. The results tell us that RUW would induce global energy and 
food security crisis for all of the countries, the big countries with large 
economic scale would face relative obvious reduction crisis of energy 
and food supply, and the little and poor countries with small economic 
scale would be more easily collapsed. Therefore, the existed interna­
tional energy and food security organizations should try to balance the 
global security demand between big countries and small countries to 
avoid the big countries to import and store too much energy and food 
that the other small countries are unable to maintain their energy and 
food security. Some new global powerful organizations can also be 
established to perform this function. We should pay more attention to 
the little and poor countries with small economic scale and low political 
status, which are the failure nodes in our mode simulation under 
LIULDS, especially the countries in the Africa and Asia to handle the risk."
We should provide more energy and food supply for them.
"4.2. Model applicability and limitation 
The model established in this study can tell us the influence of RUW 
on the global energy and cereals networks quantificationally. The net­
works robustness and resilience against RUW can be also revealed based 
on the method of this study. The key weak points in the complex 
network and influence process can be also obtained under the specific 
circumstance. The model can also support for other events influence 
assessment, especially for the evaluation of material flow network such 
as energy, food, information, metals and other important materials."

amount and decrease amount respectively."

There’s still some deficiencies require improvement in the future 
research. First of all, in this study, the international relationships are not 
considered in the current research, the energy and food flow are 
determined based on the existed flow load, however, the political ten­
dency would greatly change their decision. The influence factors of 
geography, politic and international relations order should be quantified 
and concerned in the future research (Theocharis and Jungherr., 2021)."
"The related knowledge of computational communication studies and 
political communication sciences can be further introduced to observe 
the influence of theses factors on the energy and food networks. Then 
the robustness and resilience of the evolved network can be obtained 
based on the OLUCF. Secondly, in the influence assessment of RUW, we 
assumed that Russian and Ukraine are completely destroyed as the 
initial failure nodes, although the current results can provide us guid­
ance to identify the global energy and cereals network weakness and 
risky. It possibly won’t happen in fact, so it requires us to further assess 
the influence of RUW on exports ability of Russian and Ukraine. Only the 
direct relationship between imports and exports countries are consid­
ered in the current research. The intermediate nodes can be further 
considered that import energy and food from the initial destroyed 
countries and exports to other nodes. Lastly, to achieve more available 
results, the more scenarios can be set and simulated based on the key 
parameter combination of upper-limitation node, lower-limitation node, 
coupling effect with or without consideration the global panic of RUW."
