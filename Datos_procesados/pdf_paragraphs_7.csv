On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the Ukraine. In this paper, we analyze the response of European and global 
stock markets alongside a representative sample of commodities. We compare the war response against the 
recent Covid-19 pandemic and the not-too-distant 2008 global financial crisis. Applying a Markov-switching 
HAR model on volatility proxies, estimates are made of synchronization, duration and intensity measures for 
each event. In broad terms, stock markets and commodities respond most rapidly to the Russian invasion; and 
post-invasion crisis intensity is noticeably smaller compared to both the Covid-19 and the GFC. Wheat and nickel 
are the most affected commodities due to the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"1. Introduction 
On February 24, 2022 Russia invaded the Ukraine. Moscow's MOEX 
index dropped almost 9% in the week following the invasion (Financial 
Times, 2022d). Stock market indices also registered significant losses, as 
Fig. 1 shows. Far-reaching effects in Europe, and possibly the world, are 
only beginning to unfold. Supply chain disruptions amplify the upsurge 
in commodity prices, while a massive refugee influx unfolds with almost 
7 million Ukrainians escaping their country.1 
The economic sanctions imposed in the US, Europe and elsewhere 
suggest that Russia's economy will contract significantly (Pestova, 
Mamonov, & Ongena, 2022). Rising energy revenues are unlikely to 
counteract the economic repercussions of the global pull out from 
Russia. This may prove the greatest hit to the global economy since the 
Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008; and it may exceed the impact of 
Covid-19 given the prominent exporter status of the two countries."
"Countries in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa import 
75% of their wheat from Russia and Ukraine (World Bank, 2022b)."
"Ukraine's exports of seed oil account for 40% of global exports. Over 
13% of corn exports and 5% of wheat exports come from Ukraine. Russia 
accounts for 25% of global natural gas exports, 18% of coal exports, 11% 
of crude oil exports, 18% of wheat exports and 14% of fertilizers (World 
Bank, 2022b). With countries still in a recovery phase from Covid-19, 
the after-effects of the Russian invasion are likely to have a com­
pounding effect financially. In the aftermath of Covid, forecasts indi­
cated GDP growth of 3.9%; this has been revised to −3.6% (Financial 
Times, 2022b). Inflation was expected to rise by 7.5% in 2022 (European 
Commission, 2021). However, the impact on inflation will depend on 
monetary policy response and is yet to be realised."
"Following the invasion, several studies examined the impact of 
sanctions (Berner, Cecchetti, & Schoenholtz, 2022) on global financial 
markets (Deng, Leippold, Wagner, & Wang, 2022; Huang & Lu, 2022);

on macroeconomic risks within the Euro area (Ferrara, Mogliani, & 
Sahuc, 2022); and on the international monetary system (Brunnermeier 
et al., 2022). However, sanctions are variable across countries, business 
sectors and corporations.2 Thus in this paper, we strategically steer away 
from the sanctions-based literature and examine the impact of the 
Russian-Ukrainian war on financial market volatility. We obtain and 
analyse estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity of stock 
markets and representative commodities for various segments (i.e., en­
ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We also draw 
comparisons with the impact of the 2008 GFC and the Covid-19 
pandemic. These three events constitute the main shocks to the global 
economy over the past fifteen years. For our research design we employ 
a Markov-switching HAR model on daily volatility proxies around each 
crisis. This allows for endogenously identified regime shifts upon which 
basis we compute metrics for the synchronization, duration, and in­
tensity of each crisis."
"The paper contributes to the fast-emerging literature on the impact of 
the Russian-Ukrainian war upon economic and financial outcomes. Our 
results show an instantaneous reaction of world stock markets to the 
Russian-Ukrainian war. This suggests that the invasion was interpreted 
as “real news” by investors. The timeliness of the response is unlike that 
of either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where a lag of up to seven days 
is evidenced. The crisis duration metrics, however, suggest that the 
severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has been muted compared to 
either the GFC or the Covid-19. We attribute this to an expectation that 
the war would not be prolonged. Moreover, it is possible that investors 
mis-interpret this event. Past war-like experiences have been markedly 
different; they have primarily involved one-off terrorist attacks, have 
been beyond the European continent, and were not met by widespread 
sanctions. Thereby investors may have been falsely drawing insights 
from such prior experiences. Commodity insights concur with the stock 
markets in all but one aspect: intensity. Despite average intensity values 
being comparable to both the GFC and the Covid-19, specific com­
modities (e.g., wheat, nickel, lead) reveal strong ongoing pressure in this 
asset class following the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis. Given the stra­
tegic importance to the economy of the affected commodities implica­
tions on inflation and supply chain are yet to unfold."
"The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the 
relevant literature. Section 3 presents a synopsis of the data and the 
methodology. Section 4 presents and discusses the empirical findings."
Robustness analysis is presented in section 5. A final section concludes.
"2. Background information 
2.1. Volatility and global financial markets 
Volatility is important for analysing risk in financial markets; how­
ever, it is not directly observable. The increased availability of intraday 
data has shifted attention to realised measures for volatility modelling."
"Realised volatility (RV) has been shown to dominate several parametric 
approximations, including GARCH-type and stochastic volatility (SV) 
models (Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, & Labys, 2003). Volatility is 
highly persistent, and the flexible and easy-to-estimate heterogeneous 
autoregressive (HAR) (Corsi, 2009) has emerged as a modelling work­
horse (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev, Li, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2020; 
Bollerslev, Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2018). That volatility is affected by

economic shocks is well-known. To capture structural breaks a variety of 
transition models may be embedded within the HAR framework.3 For 
example, Izzeldin, Murado˘
glu, Pappas, and Sivaprasad (2021) utilize a 
smooth-transition HAR (ST-HAR) to identify intensity, timeliness, and 
homogeneity of the Covid-19 crisis upon G7 stock markets. Parametric 
models of volatility estimation can also allow for similar dynamics, see 
for example Pappas, Ingham, Izzeldin, and Steele (2016) who use a 
Markov-switching multivariate DCC-GARCH model to examine the 
synchronicity of the GFC crisis upon European stock markets. Yip, 
Brooks, Do, and Nguyen (2020) examine the volatility spill-over effects 
between oil and agricultural products using a Markov-switching setup."
"2.2. Global financial markets and geopolitical events 
In Fig. 2 we compare the volatility reaction of financial markets to 
major geopolitical and key historical events over the last century. Using 
the S&P 500 index due to its long data availability, we calculate two 
volatility proxies, namely the realised volatility as the sum of squared 
returns over the past 22 trading days, and the conditional volatility 
estimated from a GARCH(1,1) model. In addition, we plot Economic 
Policy Uncertainty (EPU), which is a news-based indicator, and the 
historical Geopolitical Risk Index (GPRH), which gauges adverse 
geopolitical events and related risks obtained from a variety of news- 
based outlets.4 
Financial markets respond to a wide array of geopolitical events. The 
sample under consideration contains wars, invasions, terrorist attacks 
and periods of tension. A cursory inspection finds the response of global 
financial markets to the Russian-Ukrainian war to be relatively muted 
compared to other financial crises (e.g., the 2008 Lehman collapse, the 
1987 Black Monday, and the Covid-19). However, it is more pronounced 
than that of several terrorist attacks (but not the 9/11) and other in­
stances of war or invasions."
"Though wars generally have a strong impact on financial markets, 
the relevant literature is limited. Not surprisingly, Wisniewski (2016) 
finds that wars result in widespread destruction of human and physical 
capital and stock markets fall. Berkman, Jacobsen, and Lee (2011) 
investigate 447 international political crises – but not all are wars. They 
find that the global stock market returns would have been higher by 
3.6% per annum but for these events. Hudson and Urquhart (2015) 
study the effect of the second world war (WWII, thereafter) on the 
British stock market and find that only one of the wartime events clas­
sified as important resulted in a structural break. Frey and Kucher 
(2000) examine the prices of the government bonds of five European 
countries during WWII. They find that the loss and gain of national 
sovereignty affected the bond prices of the countries. Frey and Kucher 
(2001) analyse government bond prices of Germany and Austria traded 
on the Swiss bourse during WWII. They show that war episodes are 
clearly reflected in government bond prices. Brown Jr and Burdekin 
(2002) study German bonds traded on the London stock exchange

"Notes: We use the S&P 500 returns to calculate: i) realised volatility, as the sum of squared returns over the past 22 trading days; ii) conditional volatility, based on a 
GARCH(1,1) model. The Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is a news-based indicator of economic uncertainty and is available from 1985 onwards. GPRH is the 
historical geopolitical risk index."
"3 A variety of transition models have been used that typically can be classified 
according to the nature dynamics they introduce (i.e., discrete, or smooth), the 
break identification (i.e., exogenous or endogenous) and the number of breaks 
and regimes allowed. We direct you to Hamilton (1989) and Tsay (2005) for an 
in-depth discussion."
"4 Due to data limitations EPU data are available from 1985 onwards, see 
Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) for details. Caldara and Iacoviello (2022) 
construct the geopolitical risk index, which is available here. We use the “his­
torical version” for its extended coverage. The index is available here:

during WWII and document a negative impact on only two events during 
the entire conflict course. Waldenstr¨
om and Frey (2008) observe sudden 
shifts in sovereign debt yields and spreads in the Nordic bond markets 
during WWII. Frey and Waldenstr¨
om (2004) compare sovereign debt 
prices on the Zurich and Stockholm stock exchanges and conclude that 
market efficiency has not been affected by WWII."
"Some studies examine the impact of US military engagements upon 
financial markets. Leigh, Wolfers, and Zitzewitz (2003) analyse financial 
market data to assess the economic consequences of the war with Iraq."
"They find that net oil importers are most likely to experience adverse 
effects from the war. Also in respect of Iraq, Rigobon and Sack (2005) 
find that war risk is associated with declines in Treasury bond yields and 
equity prices. Amihud and Wohl (2004) find that the Iraqi war is asso­
ciated with rising stock prices. Perhaps an increasing probability that 
Saddam Hussein would be deposed was interpreted as good news by 
stock market investors. Choudhry (2010) apply a structural break test to 
investigate the structural shifts in returns and volatility and determine 
whether such shifts are associated with the events of WWII. Omar, 
Wisniewski, and Nolte (2017) analyse the impact of 64 instances of se­
vere international crisis and classify 43 events as the “war sample”."
"Their event window starts 50 trading days before the outbreak of war 
and ends 50 trading days thereafter. They find that returns were −
3.47% for the World stock market index and −4.67% for S&P 500."
"Wisniewski (2009) examine the impact of WWII, the Korean war and 
other US military engagements and provide evidence of how these 
events are negatively related to the market value of stocks. Based on the 
discussion above, we conclude that the impact of wars on stock markets 
and other asset classes is detrimental."
"2.3. Covid-19 and global financial markets 
The novel corona virus (COVID-19) was first detected in China in 
December 2019, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a 
pandemic in the following mid-March. The response across financial 
markets was dire. In a month, the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 fell by 
35% and the volatility of the financial markets was comparable to the 
2008 GFC (Baker et al., 2020). To curtail the spread rate, governments 
introduced widespread lockdown measures that impeded global eco­
nomic activity. Business sectors and countries were affected; relatedly 
Izzeldin et al. (2021) find adverse effects on all sectors but for the 
Technology firms, which weathered the pandemic better. Sergi, Harjoto, 
Rossi, and Lee (2021) show that economic outcomes, as tracked by the 
Barro Misery Index (BMI), are driven by the Covid-19 related cases and 
deaths, and are reflected on stock market return volatility. Benkraiem, 
Garfatta, Lakhal, and Zorgati (2022) conclude that financial contagion is 
more intense in America than in Asia."
"3. Data and methodology 
3.1. Data 
We examine global financial market reactions in three crises events, 
namely the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, and 
the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. For each event, we use the [−3,3] 
months estimation window using daily data.5 Our choice of the bench­
mark date (t = 0) on each occasion is: i) the Lehman Brothers collapse on 
15/9/2008; ii) the announcement of Italy's lockdown on 9/3/2020; iii) 
the invasion day on 24/2/2022, respectively.6 
Volatility data for the stock markets comprise the realised variance 
for a selection of global stock markets obtained from the OxfordMan 
institute realised library.7 Realised variance (RV) is calculated as the sum 
of squared intraday returns (Andersen et al., 2003; Andersen, Bollerslev,

Notes: The table reports key descriptive statistics for the realised volatility in each period of investigation. Mean volatility is expressed in annualized percentage terms."
Range is defined as the difference between maximum and minimum values. GFC refers to the 2008 global financial crisis; WAR to the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian war.
Realised measures are not available for Italy and Portugal during the GFC period.
"5 Our window length choice is consistent with Omar et al. (2017). As 
robustness we also use a larger window [−6,6] months for the 2008 GFC and 
the Covid-19 crisis and the results remain qualitatively similar. Thus, we retain 
our [−3,3] specification for consistency purposes across the three events."
"6 For the Covid-19 event benchmark date we concur with the Nozawa and 
Qiu (2021) study."

"Table 1 presents key descriptive statistics for the realised volatility 
across the sampled countries for the three crisis periods under exami­
nation. Brazil, Norway and Denmark emerge as the countries with the 
highest average realised volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian- 
Ukrainian war crises respectively. By contrast, Singapore exhibits the 
lowest average realised volatility during the GFC and war periods, and 
the second lowest during the Covid-19."
"Table 2 presents key descriptive statistics for the conditional vola­
tility of commodities over the three periods of crisis under examination."
"Lead, oil and natural gas are the commodities with the highest average 
conditional volatility for the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war 
periods respectively. By contrast, gold exhibits the lowest average con­
ditional volatility during the GFC and Russian-Ukrainian war periods."
Soyabean shows the lowest conditional volatility during the Covid-19.

Modelling realised measures has relied extensively on the hetero­
geneous autoregressive model (HAR) (Corsi, 2009). The superior per­
formance of the HAR in modelling and forecasting realised volatility is 
well-established (Bollerslev, 2022; Bollerslev et al., 2020; Bollerslev, 
Patton, & Quaedvlieg, 2016). Compared to ARFIMA, estimation and 
forecasting are more easily obtained from HAR models. Following Corsi 
(2009) the HAR model is defined as: 
ht = c + β(d)ht−1 + β(w)h(w)
t
+ β(m)h(m)
t
+ et
(4)  
where et~iid(0,σ2) with ht
(w) and ht
(m) defined as follows: 
h(w)
t
= 1
5 (ht−1 + ht−2 + ht−3 + ht−4 + ht−5)
(5)  
h(m)
t
= 1
22 (ht−1 + ht−2 + … + ht−21 + ht−22)
(6) 
To allow for non-linear dynamics in the volatility process we allow 
for a Markov-switching structure. Markov-switching models have been 
used in conjunction with the GARCH family of models for similar pur­
poses in Pappas et al. (2016). By contrast, Izzeldin et al. (2021) use a 
smooth transition variant of the HAR to accommodate crisis periods."
"Contrary to smooth-transition models, Markov-switching allows for a 
discrete shift in the regime, which is more appropriate for our setup 
where we compare financial market volatility during the three crises.8 
Markov-switching models utilize a latent state variable (st = m) to 
denote the state m of the economy in period t, with m = 1, …, M. By 
construction, a Markov-switching model estimates the transition prob­
ability from the data. To allow for more realistic dynamics during each 
of the turmoil periods, we assume that the HAR parameters related to 
the weekly and monthly volatility are regime invariant. The following 
Markov-switching HAR model is estimated using maximum likelihood 
and robust standard error: 
ht = cst + β(d)
st ht−1 + β(w)h(w)
t
+ β(m)h(m)
t
+ et
(7)  
where the regime probabilities are given as: 
Pr
(
st = mi|st−1 = mj
)
∀i, j = 0, 1
(8) 
For each of the three financial crises under consideration, we 
compute synchronization, duration and intensity measures following 
Pappas et al. (2016). To assess the synchronization of each financial 
crisis, we compare the estimated crisis transition date for each index (Ti)

4. Results 
4.1. Global stock markets 
Figs. 3 and 4 present the realised volatility (rebased at 1) for each 
crisis event and for a representative sample of countries. The threshold 
line is centred at each crisis date, with the graph showing the pre- and 
post-three-month evolution window. A cursory inspection finds the 
response during the Covid-19 to be more pronounced than the GFC and 
the Russian-Ukrainian war events."
"Table 3 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea­
sures for each of the GFC, Covid-19 and Russian-Ukrainian war crises. In 
each table, we report the median for each country and the median values 
for key country groupings namely the G7 economies, the European 
countries, and the rest of the world (RoW). Next, we discuss these results 
by measure focusing on Europe. Crisis synchronization median values 
suggest an instantaneous reaction of stock markets to the invasion news."
"This is observed for the Europe group, but also for the G7 and the RoW 
groups. The timeliness of the response is unlike those pertaining to the 
GFC or Covid-19 events. In the GFC crisis, synchronization show Europe 
to respond with a 4-day lag, and the G7 taking the longest at seven days."
"During the Covid-19, Europe responds at a 1-day lag; yet G7 and RoW 
take longer."
"Coming now to discuss percentage duration, we find Europe values at 
7.25%, suggesting that stock markets spent a significantly shorter period 
in the crisis regime compared to the GFC, and the Covid-19. A similar 
result is observed for the RoW countries. We discuss intensity values 
next. Our results show that crisis intensity for Europe following the 
Russian-Ukrainian war stands at 89.89%, significantly higher than 
either the GFC (at 73.76%) or the Covid-19 (at 82.16%). The G7 and 
RoW values during the Russian-Ukrainian war are 69.08% and 71.31% 
respectively. Interestingly, these values are lower for the G7 group 
compared to both the GFC and the Covid-19 (77.67% and 86.70% 
respectively), however they are comparable across all crises for the RoW 
group."
"In summary our analysis of the stock markets here suggests that their 
volatility response to the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis has been instan­
taneous. This is unlike the GFC or Covid-19 where a certain lag was 
observed. We believe that the instantaneous reaction of stock markets 
shows that the invasion was interpreted as “real news” by investors."
"Despite the prolonged summoning of Russian forces at the Ukrainian 
borders, an actual invasion had not been discounted by the markets and 
was considered unlikely, until it materialized. The crisis intensity, 
however, suggests that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has 
been, on a global scale, muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid- 
19. We find this puzzling given the severity of such an incident. It is 
plausible that investors mis-interpret this event. Past warlike experi­
ences have been markedly different in the sense that they involve mainly 
one-off terrorist attacks and/or have been away from the European 
continent. Thereby investors may be falsely drawing insights from such 
prior experiences and underestimating the real implications of the 
Russian-Ukrainian war (Financial Times, 2022e; The Guardian, 2022b)."
"However, as Russia's aggression in Ukraine remains unabated, the world 
seems to embrace that the transition into a long-term conflict appears a 
likely scenario (BBC, 2022; Financial Times, 2022a). Besides, the pro­
longed conflict has even led banks to downgrade their growth forecasts 
(JP Morgan, 2022)."
"4.2. Commodities 
Figs. 5 and 6 present the conditional volatility of commodities 
(rebased at 1) for each crisis event and for a representative sample of 
commodities. The threshold line is centered at each crisis date, with the 
graph showing the pre- and post-three-month evolution window. A 
cursory inspection of the graphs shows that commodities are affected in 
a comparable way across the three crisis events. Furthermore, the nature 
of each crisis appears to be particularly relevant for specific commod­
ities. Base materials such as copper and nickel are more affected 
following the GFC, whereas oil is more affected following the Covid-19 
crisis. The Russian-Ukrainian war crisis appears to have had a more

"Table 4 presents the synchronization, duration and intensity mea­
sures for all commodities in our sample. In addition, we report median 
values for all commodities and for each commodity segment (i.e., en­
ergy, precious metals, agricultural and base materials). We discuss 
synchronization, duration and intensity measures in turn, starting by the 
overall commodity measures and then focusing on the specific com­
modity segments. Crisis synchronization median values suggest that 
commodities respond with a 2-day lag after the invasion materialized; 
this is earlier than either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises. The early 
response of commodities is largely driven by the precious metals and 
base materials that have reacted faster. Agricultural commodities 
responded with a 2-day lag, which is comparable to the GFC crisis re­
sults. By contrast, the agricultural commodities reacted latest in the 
Covid-19 crisis, with a 17-day lag."
"We now proceed to discuss percentage duration values. During the 
Russian-Ukrainian war, the median duration has been at 6.42%, 
significantly lower than either the GFC (at 6.81%) or Covid-19 (at 
7.38%) crises. High duration values are evidenced for precious and base 
metals. Agricultural commodities show approximately two times higher 
median duration value during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to 
the Covid-19."

Commodity intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been at 
23.65%, which is similar to the other two crises. However, this aggre­
gate result masks the heterogeneity across commodity segments. Spe­
cifically, crisis intensity during the Russian-Ukrainian war has been the 
highest for the base materials (at 38.26%) and lowest for the precious 
metals (at 18.36%). Within the agricultural commodities, with an in­
tensity value of 48.87%, wheat is the most severely affected. The high 
crisis intensity value for wheat may be partially explained by the un­
certainty over Ukraine and Russia, both within the largest exporters 
worldwide, being able to meet world demand (FAO, 2022). Nickel has 
been the most severely affected commodity with an intensity value at 
116.65%. This is largely explained by the sanctions over Russia, a top-3 
nickel exporter, in conjunction with rising demand that is associated 
with its use in electric vehicles (Daniel, 2022)."
"In sum our analysis for the commodities reveals that they have 
responded faster in the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to either of the 
GFC or Covid-19 crises. By contrast, the crisis duration and intensity 
values suggest that commodities have been affected during the Russian-

Ukrainian war in a comparable way to the other two crises. Still, the 
particularly high duration and intensity values for specific commodities 
reflect the strong ongoing pressure on commodities and have been 
highlighted as a cause for concern. In particular, a stressed commodity 
market could have several ramifications, such as triggering food crises to 
putting pressure on the derivative trading platforms (Financial Times, 
2022e)."
"5. Robustness 
In the main analysis the transition between volatility regimes has 
been discrete and modelled via a Markov-switching HAR model. We 
perform a robustness check using a smooth transition specification, 
which allows for an analogue-like transition between regimes.10 Com­
mon in both specifications is the endogenous identification of the 
transition between the regimes. In the smooth transition HAR (ST-HAR) 
model the transition between two regimes is governed by the expo­
nential function, see Izzeldin et al. (2021) for more details. Of the HAR 
parameters, we assume the constant and the daily component to be 
regime dependent, while weekly and monthly volatility components are 
regime invariant. The following equation is estimated via nonlinear least 
square techniques and Newey-West robust standard errors: 
ht = β0 + β(d)ht−1 + β(w)h(w)

+ β(m)h(m)

)

(13)  
where st is a threshold variable with unknown threshold (ψ) and slope 
(γ) values; β0, δ0 and β(d), δ(d) are the threshold coefficients for the 
constant and the daily component respectively; εt is the stochastic error 
term. The threshold coefficient (ψ) gauges the synchronicity of the 
transition, with high (low) values indicating a lag (lead) in the transi­
tion. The slope coefficient may be interpreted as the transition speed 
between regimes, with high (low) values giving evidence towards an 
abrupt (gradual) shift."
"Table 5 presents the median estimated slope and threshold param­
eters of the ST-HAR model for the stock markets (Panel A) and com­
modities (Panel B). Based on their estimated values we compare the 
transition patterns across regimes for each crisis.11 
As compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19 crisis, the lower 
threshold coefficient value during the Russian-Ukrainian war indicates 
the earlier response of the global stock markets (see Panel A) and 
commodities (see Panel B) to the event. Thus, it corroborates the main 
findings of the paper."
"The slope coefficient is the highest for the G7 stock markets during 
the Russian-Ukrainian war (7.78) suggesting an abrupt regime change, 
more pronounced than either the Covid-19 (6.14) or the GFC (2.23). The 
fact that European stock markets respond in a smoother fashion to the 
Russian-Ukrainian war compared to the Covid-19 (1.55 vs 9.26) sub­
stantiates further our main finding that investors may be falsely 
assessing the severity and the duration of the event."
"Similar to global stock markets, commodities record the largest slope 
coefficient during the Russian-Ukrainian war compared to either of the 
GFC or Covid-19 crisis. The abrupt transition is mainly driven by agri­
cultural commodities (e.g., wheat) and base materials (e.g., nickel), a 
result that is consistent with the main analysis. Interestingly, precious 
materials show a more muted response compared to past crises."

markets. We analyse the volatility response of European and global stock 
markets and a representative sample of commodities to the war crisis 
and compare it against the recent Covid-19 pandemic and the 2008 
global financial crisis."
"This study employs a Markov-switching HAR model on volatility 
proxies and obtains estimates of synchronization, duration and intensity 
for each crisis event. The Markov-switching HAR model allows for an 
endogenously identified regime shift."
"Our results show an instantaneous reaction of global stock markets to 
the Russian-Ukrainian war, which suggests that the invasion was 
interpreted by investors as real news. This is markedly different to the 
GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where there was a lagged response. The 
crisis duration metrics suggest that the severity of the Russian-Ukrainian 
war has been muted compared to either the GFC or the Covid-19. We 
attribute this to the market expectations that the war would not be 
prolonged. The findings for commodity markets concur with that of 
stock markets except for one aspect: intensity. Commodities generally 
appear to have weathered the Russian-Ukrainian war crisis in a similar 
way to the Covid-19 and GFC crises. However, crisis intensity values for 
specific commodities reveal strong ongoing pressure in this asset class, 
and to the economy given the strategic importance of some of these 
commodities."
"In the short-term the Russian-Ukrainian war is expected lead to lower 
economic growth and rising inflation. Annual GDP growth in 2023 is 
projected to slow to 2.25% worldwide, to 0.5% in the US and to 0.25% in 
the Euro area; well below pre-war forecasts (OECD, 2022). Following 
the gradual global economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, 
inflationary pressure had already been building up. However, the 
Russian-Ukrainian war, with its impact on energy and food prices, has 
accelerated the inflationary pressure worldwide.12 On the energy front, 
the heavy reliance of the EU on Russia leaves the former vulnerable to 
gas supply reductions through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline (Eurostat, 
2022; Financial Times, 2022c; World Bank, 2022c). Besides, the within- 
EU heterogeneity on gas reliance leaves the union vulnerable to political 
tension, for example over the proposed 15% voluntary reduction in gas 
usage (The Guardian, 2022a)."
"The long-term consequences of the war in Ukraine will depend on 
current policy responses and priorities. Most recently, policy makers 
have been promoting energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of en­
ergy production, which is in line with the “green” goals of a transition 
away from fossil fuels to arrest climate change. However, such goals may 
become more elusive if policy makers rank energy security and 
affordability higher in their agenda. On the food market front, produc­
tion shortfalls, trade disruptions and increased input costs raise com­
modity prices, most notably wheat. Ukrainian wheat exports, that 
account for nearly 10% of global exports, ceased after the closure of 
Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Exporting wheat overland is more expensive 
than by sea (World Bank, 2022a). Rising food prices and disruptions to 
trade pose risks to the coherence of the society. Besides, food security 
ranks high on the policy makers' agendas; thus necessitating interna­
tional cooperation on these issues. With regard to metal markets, our 
results show that nickel has been heavily affected. Russia accounts for 
20% of high-grade nickel used in batteries. Sanctions have disrupted 
supply from Russia's mining giant “Nornickel”. The production of 
stainless steel, which accounts for 70% of nickel consumption is slowing, 
mainly in China (World Bank, 2022a). Developments in these com­
modities may affect the affordability of clean forms of transportation, 
and ultimately jeopardise the transition to a low-carbon economy."
"The macroeconomic impact via commodity markets and rising in­
flationary pressure may plunge global economies into recession. Stake­
holders are concerned about commodity-driven contagion effects that 
could have significant implications on financial markets and the real 
economy (Financial Times, 2022e). It remains to be seen what remedial 
steps will be taken to tackle a global recession. Future studies can further 
examine the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war and its far-reaching 
effects on global economies as the war unfolds."
