Since the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Western countries led by the United States
and the European Union have launched several energy sanctions against Russia. How will sanctions
and countersanctions on energy trade affect the EU-Russia and the world’s energy trade pattern?
This paper sets six energy trade scenarios based on the degree of energy sanctions and counter-
sanction measures imposed by the EU and Russia. We use the global multi-region comparative static
CGE model to simulate the changes in macroeconomic indicators in major countries worldwide. The
diversion effect of energy trade and the impact on the national economy caused by geographical risks
quantitatively analyzes. The results show: (1) Energy sanctions will cause economic damage to both
sides, in the worst-case scenario, the EU economic loss reaches 1.488%, the Russian loss reaches 4.8%,
and worldwide inflation will rise; (2) Russia’s counter-sanctions will have a direct economic impact
on the EU, but will not improve its economic situation; (3) Energy sanctions will bring about a direct
energy trade transfer effect, the EU’s energy imports will be diverted to non-Russian markets, and
Russian energy exports will also shift to Asian markets, and energy trade between the two economies
will be significantly reduced; (4) Energy supply will have a profound impact on the world’s economy
and society, leading to social instability and a decline in total output of 2.895%. Energy games will
have a negative impact on the world’s carbon emission reduction and energy consumption structure
transformation. Through quantitative analysis of the impact of energy sanctions on the world economy
and society, the energy game caused by the geopolitical crisis will harm both parties involved in
the game and the world economy. The world pattern will return from the development pattern of
cooperative division of labor to a situation of conflict and confrontation, which is not conducive to the
transformation of energy trade and consumption structure under market rules."

"1. Introduction
Energy trade has been dominated by geopolitics, and energy
sanctions are an extension of the political game."
"The Russia–
Ukraine conflict has led to several rounds of sanctions in the
Western world, mainly the United States and the European Union,
including individual, economic, and financial sanctions (Chepeliev
et al., 2022; Mahlstein et al., 2022). The sanctions are aimed
at weakening Russia’s economy, making it unable to pay for
its high military spending, and forcing Russia out of Ukraine."
"The most important of the measures should be sanctions on
Russia’s energy trade. The consequences of the energy sanctions
imposed by Western countries against Russia significantly impact
the economy and society of the EU and Russia more than other
stakeholders. This is mainly because the EU is highly dependent

"on Russian energy imports, and Russia’s primary energy export
market is also in Europe. Economic entities urgently want to
know what impact the energy game caused by geopolitical con-
flicts will have on the world economy and social stability and
what kind of impact it will have on the world energy trade
pattern."
"Geopolitical risks (GPRs) will directly affect energy trade, lead-
ing to energy security (Liu et al., 2021). The industrial production
of human society is highly dependent on fossil energy consump-
tion. Still, the geological distribution of fossil energy determines
that the world’s energy consumers and suppliers are in a state
of separation. Therefore, geopolitical turmoil in energy-exporting
regions directly affects the energy security of the world’s energy-
consuming countries (Inshakov et al., 2019; Vasylkivskyi et al.,
2020). Many scholars have conducted detailed research on energy
security issues arising from geopolitical conflicts (Ang et al., 2015;
Bompard et al., 2017; Kruyt et al., 2009). These studies focus
on several aspects. One is the impact of geopolitical conflicts on

energy trade (Inshakov et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). The second is
the impact of geopolitical conflicts on energy prices (Gong et al.,
2022; Liu et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022). The third is the counter-
effect of energy consumption structure transformation on geopol-
itics (Dutta and Dutta, 2022; Salameh, 2014; Su et al., 2021). The
research on the impact of geopolitical conflicts on energy trade is
mainly carried out from two aspects. First, suppose the regional
geopolitical risk of the energy-consuming country occurs. In that
case, it will lead to a decline in its energy demand, triggering
a reduction in the country’s dependence on global energy trade."
"Geopolitical conflicts in such energy-consuming countries have a
relatively limited impact on international energy trade (Lee et al.,
2017). On the other side is the geopolitical conflict between en-
ergy exporters. Political instability in energy-exporting countries
can directly impact global energy supply through supply chains
such as energy output and transportation (Yang et al., 2014). In
GPRs research, a more critical research direction is the impact
of GPRs on energy prices and will combine oil price fluctuations
with the energy security of energy-importing countries. However,
there are still differences in academic research on the mechanism
of GPRs on oil prices. Cunado et al. (2019) show that only a higher
GPR drives up oil prices through dynamic research on GPR versus
actual oil returns between 1974 and 2017. Noguera-Santaella
(2016) found through an analysis of essential oil price fluctuations
and interventions in different geopolitical events that geopolit-
ical events had different impacts on oil prices in 2000. With
the conclusion of carbon emission reduction agreements around
the world, the world’s major energy-consuming countries have
begun to change their energy consumption structure, gradually
increasing the proportion of renewable energy and reducing fossil
energy consumption (Vakulchuk et al., 2020). The transformation
of the energy structure has had a considerable impact on the
world’s geopolitical conflicts. Since 2010, many scholars have
noted that renewable energy consumption may bring new geopo-
litical conflicts. Scholars’ research views on this issue are also
divided. On the one hand, they believe that the energy transition
is unlikely to reduce energy-related conflicts (Escribano, 2018;
Freeman, 2018; Hurd et al., 2012; Jacobson et al., 2017; Raman,
2013). The other side believes that energy-related conflicts will
decrease as the energy transition deepens and the proportion
of energy self-sufficiency in countries gradually increases (Pierri
et al., 2017; Scholten and Bosman, 2016; Smith Stegen, 2018), the
increased use of renewable energy reduces the influence of oil
and gas exporters in global politics (Su et al., 2021)."
"The impact of geopolitical conflicts on capital markets and
social welfare is also an important theoretical and empirical
research direction. Energy price fluctuations have a heteroge-
neous effect on importing and exporting countries. For energy-
consuming countries, rising energy prices mean higher produc-
tion and transportation costs while affecting capital market liq-
uidity through inflation and interest rates, reducing social welfare
levels (Antonakakis et al., 2017). On the other hand, energy
suppliers have seen rising incomes, leading to higher domestic
consumption, investment, and productivity, more liquidity in
capital markets, and higher overall social welfare (Apergis et al.,
2015). At the same time, GPRs have a significant impact on
market sentiment, investment, and decision-making behavior in
energy markets, and these effects are ultimately reflected in
energy price fluctuations (Humphreys, 2005; Ji et al., 2019a,b)."
"Previous research on geopolitical conflict and energy security
has focused on using empirical analysis methods to analyze the
relationship between GPRs and energy security indices or energy
price indices. The impact of energy sanctions on world energy
trade has rarely been studied from the perspective of geopolitical
conflicts by the GTAP model. The tensest Russia–Ukraine conflict
has triggered a political game around the world. Unlike the past
world energy security problems caused by GPRs, this contest
between the EU and Russia in the energy field will likely reshape
the world energy trade pattern. So, in the energy game caused
by geopolitical conflicts, what is the EU’s and Russia’s macroeco-
nomic impact? What is the diversion effect of conflict on world
energy trade? What impact will it have on transforming the
world’s energy structure? These are all issues of great concern to
decision-makers worldwide and need to be solved urgently. This
study uses the GTAP model to evaluate the impact of different
levels of energy sanctions on energy trade and macroeconomics
on both sides of sanctions. The study finds that: (1) Energy
sanctions will bring macroeconomic losses to both sides of the
game, and Russia’s economic losses are more serious, but the
EU will bear a higher level of inflation, and the world will be
plagued by high inflation; (2) Russia’s energy counter-sanctions
can produce specific effects, but at the cost of deteriorating its
economic situation; (3) energy sanctions will lead to a decrease in
direct energy trade between the two countries, but an increase in
indirect energy trade; (4) The energy game between the two sides
will directly drag down the development of the world economy,
lead to a decline in total world output, and adversely affect
carbon emission reduction and energy consumption structure
transformation."
"The marginal contribution of this paper is: First, under the
framework of the global trade model, it quantitatively reveals the
global impact of the energy game between the EU and Russia
caused by geopolitical conflicts, measures the impact effect of
energy sanctions on both sides, and from the results of the escala-
tion of the energy game, the two sides can only lose in this game;
Second, in the global integration pattern, the competition be-
tween energy consuming countries and energy supplier countries
will be weakened through the transfer effect of energy trade, and
diversified energy demand and supply will become the central
theme of world energy trade in the future; Third, it provides new
evidence for studying the mechanism of geopolitical conflicts on
energy prices. The remainder of this paper is structured in the
following manner. The second part provides an overview of the
state of energy trade between the EU and Russia. The third part
introduces the methods and data used in this paper. The fourth
part analyzes the empirical results of the article. Part V draws
conclusions based on the results of the analysis."
"2. Overview of energy trade between the EU and Russia
2.1. Comparison of EU and Russian aggregate indicators
As a member of the Political and Economic Community, the
EU has 27 member States and a total population of approximately
446 million. The purpose of the EU is ‘‘to promote the balanced
economic and social development of member States through
establishing a space without internal boundaries, the coordinated
development of the economy and society, and establishing an
economic and monetary union leading to a unified currency’’."
"Since its inception, the European Union has been at the center of
the world economy and politics. The total GDP of the EU in 2021
ranks third in the world after the United States and China, ranking
third in the world economy, and the entire trade volume of the EU
has also reached 13,082.447 billion dollars. As can be seen from
Table 1, the EU’s large-scale economic activities require massive
energy consumption, and the total primary energy consumption
of the EU in 2020 reached 55.74 exajoules, accounting for 10.01%
of the world’s total immediate energy consumption. However, the
EU’s own fossil energy reserves are insufficient, with oil reserves
accounting for only 0.1% of the world’s oil reserves, natural gas
reserves accounting for 0.2% of the world’s total, and coal re-
serves accounting for 7.3% of the world’s resources. The enormous

energy consumption by economic development and the lack of
funds determine that the EU cannot achieve self-sufficiency in
energy and needs to purchase a large amount of energy from
outside. Russia’s total energy consumption is relatively low com-
pared to the EU’s. The GDP of the Russian Federation is only 11th
in the world GDP ranking in 2021, and it has a population of about
143 million. Although the level of economic activity is not high,
Russia has abundant energy and mineral resources, of which, as of
2020, proven oil reserves account for 6.2% of the world’s reserves,
natural gas reserves account for 19.9% of the world’s resources,
and coal reserves account for 15.1% of the world’s reserves, so
it also determines Russia’s economic structure based on energy
exports."
"2.2. EU energy structure analysis
Since the implementation of the first climate change plan
in 2000, the total primary energy consumption of the EU has
been on a downward trend since 2006. Due to the impact of
the pandemic, EU energy consumption fell sharply in 2020 until
it rebounded sharply in 2021. According to Fig. 1, the perspec-
tive of the EU’s energy consumption structure, the proportion of
crude oil consumption has been declining from 41.35% in 2000 to
35.46% in 2021, the proportion of renewable energy and natural
gas consumption is rising, the proportion of renewable energy
consumption has increased sharply from 0.9% to 13.17%, and
natural gas consumption has increased from 19.94% to 23.75%."
"Although the EU’s energy reform policy has achieved the goal of
reducing the total primary energy consumption, there is still a
gap between the energy structure transformation goal of reducing
the proportion of fossil energy consumption and increasing the
ratio of renewable energy consumption to 20%. The analysis of
EU fossil energy reserve indicators shows that the EU’s economic
development needs energy imports from external markets."
"From the perspective of the structure of the EU energy import
trade, Russia is the leading importer of EU energy. In 2020, the
EU relied on imports for 58% of its energy consumption, and
its self-sufficiency rate was only 42%. While the EU has been
trying to wean itself off Russian energy imports, Russia is the
EU’s leading supplier of gas, oil, and coal. In 2021, the EU’s oil,
refined oil, and coal imports from Russia accounted for 29.64%,
38.44%, and 48.08% of its various energy imports. As the primary
fossil energy supporting the EU’s green energy transformation,
natural gas imports mainly include pipeline imports and liquefied
imports, of which pipeline natural gas transportation accounts for
68.26% of the total natural gas imports. In 2021, natural gas from
Russia accounted for 71.74% of EU pipeline transport imports, and
liquefied natural gas imports accounted for 20% in Russia. The
main reason the EU depends on Russian energy is related to Rus-
sia’s abundant energy reserves, low prices, and low transportation
costs, especially the construction of gas transportation pipelines,
such as Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2."
"Combined with the current situation of the EU energy trade,
the EU’s short-term implementation of severe energy sanctions
against Russia will cause a more serious energy shortage in the
EU."
"2.3. Energy trade in Russia
Russia occupies a critical position in the world’s energy supply
chain as a country with relatively rich energy reserves. According
to data published by the Russian Federal Customs Service, global
oil demand shrank sharply in 2020 due to the epidemic’s impact."
"Russia and Saudi Arabia have implemented production cuts, and
oil and gas exports have hit new lows —
resulting in a 36.6%
reduction in exports of energy goods. Even with a sharp decrease
in energy demand, the share of energy goods exports in Russia’s
export trade fell from 62.1% in 2019 to 49.6% in 2020, which is
still the highest. In other words, Russia’s foreign trade structure is
still dominated by the export of energy commodities. By the end
of 2020, crude oil accounted for the most significant proportion
of Russia’s trade value of different energy types, accounting for
47.51% of the total energy trade, followed by the export of crude
oil products, accounting for 30.62% of the total. As shown in Fig. 2,
Russian crude oil export destinations are concentrated in Europe
and Asia, of which oil exports to Europe account for 53.05%
of the total value of oil exports, and Asia accounts for 45.22%."
"Among the Asian destinations for Russian crude exports, China is
its largest buyer, importing 32% of Russia’s crude. In continental
Europe, the Netherlands imports 12.4% of Russian crude oil, and
Germany imports 8.57% of Russian crude oil. The export trade
structure of Russian crude oil products is more dependent on the
European market. The value of crude oil products exported by
Russia to European countries accounted for 60.37% of the total
export value, while Asia accounted for 26.59%. The refined oil
imports of the Netherlands, France, and Germany accounted for
14.1%, 6.08%, and 4.62% of Russia’s exports, respectively. Russia’s
petroleum gas export trade is more dependent on the European
market, which consumes 71.92% of Russia’s petroleum gas, and
the rest is almost entirely exported to the Asian market. Coal
exports are of relatively small value and more dispersed than the
top three energy commodity destinations. An analysis of Russia’s
energy trade structure shows that Europe and Asia are the main
markets for its energy trade. The European market is currently
more important than the Asian market. This energy trade struc-
ture will shift significantly with the EU’s energy sanctions against
Russia."

"2.4. Analysis of the EU’s dependence on Russian energy
Through the analysis of EU energy consumption and the struc-
ture of Russian energy export trade, it can be seen that the EU
is highly dependent on energy commodities provided by Russian
energy, and Russia’s foreign energy trade is also dependent on
the European market. Through the analysis of the EU’s energy
consumption and the structure of Russia’s energy export trade,
the EU is highly dependent on energy commodities provided by
Russian energy. In contrast, Russia’s foreign energy trade also
depends on the European market. There are three main reasons
for the EU’s dependence on Russian energy. First, the geographical
advantage between Russia and the EU makes it the most conve-
nient for the EU to obtain energy from Russia with the lowest
transportation cost. Second, the EU’s aggressive energy transition
policy has led to the withdrawal of traditional energy sources
from the market too quickly, resulting in large fluctuations in
the internal energy supply. Third, the development speed of
renewable energy is not as fast as expected, and the stability
is poor. Through the analysis of the EU’s energy reserve data,
it can be seen that the EU’s energy reserves are not enough to
support economic development needs. The geographical location
between Russia and the EU is more advantageous than other
energy suppliers in the world, and the two major economies have
reduced the cost of energy transportation through the construc-
tion of oil and gas transportation pipelines, which has formed the
physical basis of the EU’s dependence on Russian energy. With
the increasing importance of ecological and environmental issues
in the EU, it has proposed a radical energy consumption struc-
ture transformation plan. In this plan, increasing the proportion
of renewable energy and reducing traditional fossil energy are
essential indicators. The implementation of the policy has led
to the large-scale closure of coal-fired thermal power plants in
Euro member countries, turning to natural gas and renewable
energy. In the energy transformation process, natural gas, as a
cleaner energy source compared to other fossil energy sources,
has been used in large quantities to meet the set emission reduc-
tion targets. Russia has exported a large amount of natural gas
to the EU through Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines to complete
the transformation of the EU’s energy consumption structure."
"Whether or not the EU undergoes an energy transition, it will be
challenging to eliminate its dependence on cheap Russian energy."
"Therefore, the EU’s energy ban on Russia will directly affect its
energy security. In the short and medium term, it will be difficult
for the EU to find a suitable energy supply organization to replace
Russia. The diversion effect of energy trade will lead to a rapid
increase in energy prices, affecting the welfare and social and
political stability of EU member states."
"In summary, as an essential demand side and supply side in
the world energy pattern, the impact and changes in energy trade
between the two countries will have a spillover effect on the
global energy trade pattern, which will affect the stability of the
worldwide energy trade network structure. The energy game be-
tween the two economies is bound to disrupt the existing energy
trade network and threaten global energy security. Therefore, it
is necessary to quantitatively analyze the energy game between
the EU and Russia to understand the effects of world energy trade
and the macroeconomic impact caused by the conflict between
the two countries."
"3. Method and data
3.1. Method
To simulate the impact of energy sanctions and countersanc-
tions between the EU and Russia on the two major economies
and the world economy under geopolitical conflicts, this paper
conducts an empirical analysis based on the global multi-region
comparative static CGE model, known as the Global Trade Anal-
ysis Project (GTAP), developed by Purdue University. The project
is widely used in the study of international trade disputes (Cui
and Song, 2017; Itakura, 2014). To study the impact of energy

Fig. 3. The basic structure of the production module in GTAP-E."
"sanctions on economies and energy trade, this paper uses the
GTAP-E model. The GTAP-E model is an extended application of
the GTAP standard model in the field of environment. The GTAP-E
model incorporates energy as a factor input into the production
structure, introduces carbon tax variables and carbon emissions
trading mechanisms, and modifies the modules of production,
consumption, carbon tax, and welfare decomposition. The basic
structure of the specific production module is shown in Fig. 3."
"The production module of the GTAP-E model is embedded
with multiple levels of conversion substituted elastic (CES) pro-
duction functions, and capital and energy products can be substi-
tuted for each other. The basic production factors of the GTAP-E
model include not only land, labor, and natural resources, but
also capital–energy composite elements. Capital and energy can
be substituted for each other, and this module uses the CES
production function to characterize that if energy prices rise
relative to capital prices, companies will replace capital inputs
with energy products. Energy products are further divided into
electricity and non-electricity composite elements, which can
be further decomposed into coal, crude oil, natural gas, and
petroleum products, and each stage composite structure adopts
the CES production function. Different from the traditional GTAP
model, the GTAP-E model distinguishes the energy input in the
production module from other non-energy intermediate inputs,
considering the substitution of energy inputs with other basic
production factors. On this basis, the GTAP-E model can accu-
rately trace the energy consumption in the production process
to investigate the ‘‘economic-energy-carbon emission’’ impact of
policy changes. Therefore, the GTAP-E model is an important tool
for energy policy and climate policy simulation."
"In the past, when simulating the EU-Russia energy embargo,
scholars used the form of shock tariff variables (tms) to change
the volume of a particular country’s trade in a specific commodity
(Chepeliev et al., 2022). They directly transferred the tax revenue
to the importing country. However, the energy game between the
EU and Russia is mainly to now cut off energy trade between the
two countries in the form of an executive order, so this paper
divides the tariff revenue from the exporting country based on
the import tariff adjustment to ensure that the simulation results
are more realistic."
"3.2. Data
The impact simulations in this study are based on GTAP-E data,
the most recent data for the current period, and the simulation
base period is 2014. The GTAP-E version of the database subdi-
vides the world into 141 regions, each containing 65 production
departments. To study the impact of the energy game between
the EU and Russia on both sides and the world’s major countries,
this paper divides the 141 countries in the database into the Euro-
pean Union, Russia, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, India, the
United States, the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), other Middle
East and North Africa countries (XMN), OPEC member countries
(OPEC), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and
the rest of the world (ROW). To study the heterogeneous impact
of shocks on different levels of dependency, the 27 EU member
states were classified as highly dependent (EUhdR), moderately
reliant on Russian energy (EUmdR), and low dependent (EUldR)
according to their dependence on Russian energy.1

"To study the heterogeneous impact of energy trade restrictions
on different industries in the EU and Russia, the 65 production
sectors in the GTAP-E database were divided into 12 industry
groups. At the same time, the energy game between the EU and
Russia occurred in 2022, and the entry into force of sanctions on
specific energy projects also happened in that year, so the base
year of the simulation was set as 2022. However, the base year
of the GTAP-E database is 2014, so the actual GDP, population,
capital stock, and labor force data of the Econmap database of the
French World Economic Research Center are used to dynamically
recurse the data from 2014 to 2021, according to the research
method (Ahmed et al., 2020)."
"3.3. Conflict scenarios setting
As the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to escalate,
EU sanctions against Russia are also changing. Considering the
energy trade structure of the two economies and the EU’s energy
sanctions, this article sets up six short-term scenarios, as shown
in Table 2. From the perspective of the energy trade structure of
the two major economies, the EU is highly dependent on Russian
energy imports. In Russia’s trade structure, energy exports are the
backbone of its economy. To sanction Russia for waging war in
Ukraine, the EU has reduced or banned imports of Russian energy
goods to combat its economy. In the scenario S1 setup, we set
the EU to voluntarily cut off coal imports from Russia following
the EU’s Fifth package of sanctions proposed on April 8, 2022."
"In S2, Russia took countermeasures in response to EU energy
sanctions. Since the EU highly depends on Russian natural gas
energy, Russia will use natural gas exports as a countermeasure."
"Russia will reduce its gas exports to the EU by 30%. S3 said that
Russia retaliated against the EU energy ban. If the EU strictly
enforced the prohibition of Russian coal exports, Russia would
reduce its gas exports to the EU by 50% in retaliation for various
EU sanctions. In the S4 scenario, if the EU has not prevented
the escalation of the situation in Russia and Ukraine after pass-
ing previous sanctions against Russia. The EU will increase the
sanctions based on the original sanctions. The new sanctions in-
clude related products such as crude oil and refined oil products."
"Considering the different degrees of dependence of EU member
states on Russian energy, the implementation of sanctions will
vary. The EUldR and EUmdR countries in the EU will completely
ban imports of Russian crude oil and refined oil products, but
the EUhdR countries will reduce Russian crude oil and refined
oil products imports by 70%. In the S5 scenario, Russia would
reduce its natural exports to the EU by 80% in response to the
escalation of EU sanctions. The S6 scenario simulates the extreme
scenario of a two-way game, in which the EU completely bans
energy products from Russia, and Russia cuts off gas exports to
the EU."
"4. Results and discussion
4.1. Direct effects of energy sanctions
4.1.1. GDP and GDP deflator
Table 3 shows the real GDP and GDP deflator changes in the
EU regions, Russia, and corresponding world regions. A complete
cessation of energy trade between the EU and Russia would lead
to a 2.895% drop in world GDP. The shock results of different
scenarios show that the impact on economies of whether or not
to embargo oil and petroleum products varies widely. When the
EU bans Russian coal in scenario S1, the economic damage to
the EU is up to 0.099% and 0.891% to Russia. Russia’s counter-
sanctions measures can blow the EU economy, but they cannot
improve the economic losses caused by sanctions. Once the EU
imposes sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, the
economic losses to both sides will skyrocket. In the scenario of a
hard decoupling of energy trade between the two sides (S6), the
economic losses of the EU consortium would reach 1.488%, while
the GDP losses of Russia would get 4.8%. In the game between
the two sides, there is no economic winner, and the sanctions
of both sides will cause economic damage to the other, but the
economic losses for Russia will be higher. At the same time, other
participants in this event, such as the members of the G7 group,
have been less affected in the energy game between the EU and
Russia (such as the United Kingdom, the highest loss is only
−0.0712%), or even benefited. For example, the United States has
maintained positive economic growth. As the game between the
two sides intensifies, its economic growth degree has increased,
reaching a maximum of 0.1165%."
"The change in the GDP deflator shows that energy sanctions
will increase the cost of energy prices in EU member states,
leading to higher inflation. Judging by the data on energy trade
between the EU and Russia, the EU’s energy consumption is
highly dependent on Russian energy imports, especially natural
gas. Therefore, the EU’s sanctions on Russian energy will directly
cause a massive gap in the energy supply, leading to a rapid
rise in energy prices and production costs of energy-intensive
industries. As seen in scenarios 1 to 3 from Table 4, the EU GDP
deflator increased from 0.137% to 0.287%. As a sanctioned party,
Russia suffered a decline of up to 0.442% in the GDP deflator
due to setbacks in foreign trade, which may trigger deflation at
home. This is only a scenario in scenarios S1–S3 that does not
involve sanctions on crude oil and crude oil products. If the EU
imposes sanctions against Russia’s strict embargo on crude oil
products, the impact on the price level of both sides will be
huge. The EU’s GDP deflator rose directly to 0.502%, while Russia’s
GDP deflator fell instantly to 4.022%. The deflationary impact of
sanctions on Russia will be stronger than the inflationary effect of
the EU. Due to member states’ different degrees of dependence on
Russian energy within the EU, there will be significant differences
in the level of shocks. EU member states highly dependent on

Russian energy will suffer the most from the sanctions imposed."
"At the same time, countries with low dependence will have a
lower impact, which will also be a key factor affecting whether
sanctions can be agreed upon in the EU. Looking at the effects
of the EU’s energy sanctions on Russia from the perspective of
the international economy, we can draw a bare conclusion that
is, the implementation of energy sanctions will directly promote
the general rise in energy prices around the world, increasing the
world GDP deflator."
"4.1.2. Changes in welfare levels
In the GTAP model, changes in resident welfare are measured
in the form of equivalent variation changes (EVs). EU energy sanc-
tions against Russia will lead to losses in world welfare levels, up
to 40,860.18 million dollars. After Russia suffers energy sanctions,
the welfare of residents drops significantly, especially when crude
oil and crude oil products are sanctioned, which has a significant
negative impact on the welfare of residents in Russia. Through
the decomposition of changes in the welfare of residents, the
most critical factor affecting the decline in the welfare of Russian
residents is the change in the terms of trade, which contributed
more than 70% of the negative impact. The EU’s complete cut-
off of trade with Russian energy products (S6) will lead to a
decline in EU residents’ welfare level by 13938.58 million dollars."
"Unlike the reasons for the decline in the welfare level of Russian
residents, the reduction in the level of welfare of EU residents is
due to allocative effects. The allocative effect is mainly generated
by the impact of energy restrictions on regional production and
household consumption. Due to the high dependence of the EU on
Russia for energy consumption, the implementation of an energy
ban will lead to a shortage of regional energy supply, making the
supply of raw materials for energy-intensive industries insecure,
so the output of the related industries will decline. Energy restric-
tions will also cause the cost of living to rise rapidly. According
to EU statistics, inflation in the EU region was as high as 9.6% in
July 2022 after implementing energy restrictions. A rapid rise in
the price index and a rapid decline in output in energy-intensive
industries will lead to a significant decrease in household welfare."
"The increase in sanctions between the two sides will improve
the welfare of residents of other energy export organizations, the
most obvious of which is the EEU, the Eurasian Economic Union,
as a Russian-led economic organization, played a role in energy
re-export when Russia was sanctioned, and played a positive role
in the trade export volume of member countries (see Table 5)."
"4.1.3. Changes in terms of trade and import trade
The sanctions imposed by the EU and G7 member states
have severely impacted Russia’s terms of trade(tot), and as the
sanctions are carried out, the terms of trade of EU member
states have also been damaged. As shown in Table 6, in the

S1 and S4 scenarios, Russia’s tot deteriorated by 0.191% and
4.833%, respectively. Due to restrictions on Russian energy im-
ports and the impact of Russian countersanctions, the EU’s tot
continued to deteriorate in scenarios S2 and S3. Although Russia’s
counter-sanctions have served the purpose of its policy, the cost
is two-way, and it has adversely affected its tot. Suppose the
EU strictly implements energy sanctions against Russia, which
eventually leads to the interruption of energy trade between the
two sides. In that case, it will significantly negatively impact the
tot between the two sides. The EU’s persistent energy supply
shortage will have a contagion effect on the trade of other EU
industries, such as energy-intensive industries, agriculture, chem-
ical industries, etc., and the EU’s tot will further deteriorate. For
additional energy exporters, the energy game between the EU
and Russia has caused international oil prices to rise, boosting
their energy exports and incomes. To compensate for the energy
gap, the EU has correspondingly reduced tariffs on energy imports
from other countries, which has promoted the improvement of
other countries’ tot to a certain extent."
"From the perspective of the impact of energy sanctions on
the import and export trade of the two sides, both sanctions
and countersanctions significantly impact the import and export
trade of the two sides, mainly on exports for Russia and imports
for EU member states. Implementing sanctions on energy im-
ports by EU member states will directly reduce the total energy
imports of the EU, which will reduce the total EU imports. In
the simulation, total EU imports fell the most at S6, reaching
2.404%, shown in Table 7. Considering the practical dilemma
of the EU in adjusting the energy trade structure in the short
term, energy import restrictions will become the most significant
hidden danger to the EU’s energy security. The energy ban has
an even more substantial impact on Russia’s import and export
trade, with total imports falling by 6.23% and exports by 8.56%
in the S6 scenario. According to the policy simulation results,
EEU, an economic cooperation alliance led by Russia, has seen a
significant increase in its import and export volume during the
sanctions period. In the S6 scenario, EEU imports increased by
5.82%, and exports increased by 5.32%. Russia can transfer energy
trade through the EEU and other countries. Although there is a
change, the import and export of the rest of the world’s nations
are insignificant."
"4.2. Indirect effects of energy sanctions
4.2.1. Energy trade transfer effects
Fig. 4 shows the diversion effect of the energy ban on the EU’s
energy import trade. With the escalation of EU energy sanctions
against Russia, energy trade between the two sides will decline
significantly. In the S1 scenario, energy trade between the EU and
Russia fell by 5.26% after EU sanctions on Russian coal imports."
"With the counter-sanction measures imposed by Russia, EU gas
supplies will be limited, negatively impacting energy trade be-
tween the two sides. In the S3 scenario, the EU energy trade with
Russia will fall by 10.19%. There is no significant energy transfer

"effect when sanctions are imposed only on Russian coal. The EU’s
energy market is still dominated by Russian energy, but there
are also signs of energy transfer. In S3, Russia’s energy gap with
the EU will be transferred to the EU through the EEU. At the
same time, the EU will look for alternatives to Russia’s energy gap
worldwide. The more significant phenomenon is that OPEC, XMN,
and ROW account for a substantial increase in the EU’s energy
structure."
"The EU continues escalating energy sanctions against Russia,
covering crude and crude oil products. Implementing these sanc-
tions will have a non-negligible impact on the EU’s short-term
energy security and even lead to differences within the EU on
sanctions against Russia. In scenario S4, energy trade between the
EU and Russia would fall by 81.69%, and if Russia countersanc-
tions against the EU by reducing gas supplies (S5), energy trade
between the two would fall by 90.68%. The transfer effect map
of energy trade shows that the imposition of severe sanctions on
Russian crude oil and crude oil products will significantly change
the EU’s energy structure. Russia’s share of the EU’s energy mix
is rapidly declining. The EU can only fill the gap in the energy
market by increasing energy imports from other energy supply
organizations. Russia will transfer exports to the EU through
third-party channels, such as the Eurasian Economic Union. And
Russia is also actively developing new energy exporters, such
as India, China, and other non-Western world countries. In the
process of EU sanctions against Russia, Russia’s foreign energy
trade exports fell from 2.267% in the S1 scenario to 22.818% in
the S6 scenario, which played a role in the sanctions against
the Russian energy economy. In the simulation, other energy
exporters can supplement the EU’s energy demand. The total
energy supply situation may be worse than the model scenario,
so whether the EU will continue to impose energy sanctions on
Russia will be decided based on the actual energy supply scenario."
"4.2.2. Energy trade transfer coefficient
To study the impact of the EU energy ban on the flow of energy
trade between the EU and Russia, we define the energy trade
transfer coefficient with reference to the practice of Cui et al."
"(2018). Use this indicator to find the countries and organizations
with the most apparent energy trade diversion effect in sanctions."
"The EU energy trade import transfer factor is the increase in EU
energy imports from third countries divided by the decrease in EU
energy imports from Russia. This indicator measures the extent to
which the EU’s energy imports to other countries expand for ev-
ery $1 reduction in EU energy imports from Russia. Similarly, the
export transfer factor for Russian energy trade is defined as the
increase in Russia’s energy exports to third countries divided by
the decrease in Russia’s energy exports to the EU, which reflects
the extent to which Russia’s energy exports to other countries
expand for every $1 reduction in Russia’s energy exports to the
EU."
"Fig. 5 shows the energy trade transfer coefficients between
the EU and Russia in different scenarios. The import transfer
coefficients of the EU energy trade are all positive, indicating that
the EU has a shift in imports of energy trade. In each scenario, the
expansion of EU energy imports from the USA, EEU, XMN, OPEC,
and ROW is more pronounced. At the same time, the import
transfer coefficient of the EU in scenarios S1–S3 is significantly
higher than that of energy imports in scenarios S4–S6. Mainly due
to the EU’s sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products
in the S4 scenario, the EU’s energy imports from Russia have
decreased rapidly, while the increase in imports from third coun-
tries has grown at a low rate. This shows that if the EU imposes
strict restrictions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products,
although it can make up for part of the energy gap by increasing
the energy imports of third countries, the energy supply gap will
still exist. Energy sanctions will force Russia to transfer more
energy to Asian countries. Russia’s export expansion to CHN,
IND, USA, EEU, ROW, and other regions is more prominent. This
simulation is consistent with the real-world adjustment of the
Russian energy export trade. According to OECD data, since the
EU and G7 imposed sanctions on Russia, Russia’s crude oil and
crude oil products exported to China have increased by about 55%
year-on-year."
"4.3. The socioeconomic impact of the energy ban
4.3.1. Impact on residents
The energy ban has had a significant negative impact on the
world’s inhabitants. Most countries are plagued by inflation while
developing countries also need to worry about the food crisis. The
most affected are the two sides of the game. The chart below
shows the impact of the EU energy ban on commodity prices
on both sides. The energy ban imposed by the EU has brought
intolerable inflation, especially in EU member states, which are
highly dependent on Russian energy. In scenarios S1–S3 shown
in Fig. 6, the most significant increase in the price of various
commodities in EU member states was natural gas, with gains
of 4.22%, 3.42%, and 3.39%, and the costs of other items increased
to a certain extent. Starting from scenario S4, the rise of com-
modities in EU member states began to differ, and the prices
of crude oil and crude oil products in EUhdR member countries
began to rise rapidly, with the maximum price increase of crude
oil products in scenario S6 reaching 20.32% and crude oil prices
rising by 15.87%. Prices of other energy-related commodities have
also risen significantly. In scenario S6, the electricity prices of
EUhdR, EUmdR, and EUldR increased by 10.12%, 6.95%, and 6.77%,
respectively. On August 18, 2022, Eurostat released data showing
that the annual inflation rate in the EU and the eurozone reached
9.8% and 8.6%, respectively, in July 2022. The reality is that since
the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia, energy and electricity
prices in EU countries have risen even faster than the settlement
results of the model. During this period, the cost of natcostgas,

"which EU countries mainly rely on, has increased from an average
of about 70 euros per megawatt hour per month in February
2022 to a maximum of 300 euros/MWh, an increase of 321.4%,
while German electricity prices have exceeded the 700 euro mark
for the first time, reaching a record 710 euros/MWh. The rise in
energy prices in EU member states is consistent with, or even
higher than, the model’s simulations, which include uncertain
market expectations for the future EU-Russia energy game."
"According to the model simulation, the price of various do-
mestic outputs in Russia will see a large-scale price decline due
to the restriction of energy exports, among which the cost of
energy commodities will fall most obviously. In scenario S6, the
price of crude oil falls by 11.12%, the price of crude oil products
falls by 9.32%, and the domestic economy should have severe
deflation. But Russia has seen historical inflation, with the an-
nualized inflation rate rising to 17.49% year-on-year in the week
ending April 8, the highest since February 2002, according to
the Russian Ministry of Economic Development. The main reason
for this is the rapid and significant depreciation of the ruble."
"Currency depreciation and the epidemic’s impact have caused
Russian residents to reduce service consumption and increase
consumption of physical goods."
"4.3.2. Impact on social output
The energy ban has a heterogeneous impact on social output in
the EU and Russia. The negative effect on the output of all sectors
of society in the EU member states is consistent, and the impact
on the output of the Russian industry is concentrated in the
energy sector. The energy ban stimulates the exploitation of the
EU’s energy reserves. The implementation of the ban has allowed
the EU to expand non-Russian energy imports while also turning
its attention to internal energy resource reserves. As shown in
Table 8, starting with scenario S1, the EU’s coal sector output
increased by 5.192% to address the gap in coal supply. And with
the escalation of the energy ban, the output of the coal industry
has maintained a high growth rate. In scenario S6, the coal sector
output growth reached 9.434%. At this time, the increase in coal
output is more to meet the electricity demand and alleviate
the power supply shortage caused by natural gas and crude oil."
"The most apparent impact of the ban on EU industry output is
the power sector, energy-intensive industries, and the output of
crude oil products. In scenario S6, the output declines of the three
sectors were 5.389%, 6.913, and 5.307, respectively. As the blood
of modern industry, the lack of oil will cause the output of all
societal sectors to suffer a negative impact. In addition to the
obvious negative impact on industries with high energy tightness,
the output of the GrainsCrops industry has also been significantly
impacted, resulting in a 2.796% decline in industry output, mainly
due to the decrease in the production in energy-intensive sectors
such as fertilizers."
"The energy ban on Russian industry output is mainly concen-
trated in the energy sector. At the beginning of the ban shown
in Table 9, it led to a 14.105% drop in the output of the Russian
coal industry. The escalation of the energy ban, it will have a
significant impact on the output of Russian crude oil and crude oil
products, resulting in a decline in output of 10.421% and 3.546%,
respectively. From the perspective of changes in the output of
other industries in Russia, in addition to the significant negative
impact on the energy industry, the effect on the output of other
sectors of society is small, and even the output of the industry has
a positive promotion effect. Most notably, the output of energy-
intensive industries increased by 14.295% in scenario S6. The
main reason for this phenomenon is that when Russia’s energy
exports encounter obstacles, in addition to opening up export
markets outside the EU, it will also moderately reduce the output
and export quota of energy resources and use the domestic indus-
trial system to produce and process restricted commodities such
as coal and crude oil through energy-intensive industrial systems
such as chemical industry, and convert them into other forms
of export, to circumvent the international community’s ban on
energy exports."
"4.3.3. Impact on greenhouse gas emissions
As shown in Table 10, in the short term, energy sanctions will
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Simulations of GTAP10-E data
show that world CO2 levels have decreased significantly with
the escalation of energy sanctions, with world CO2 emissions
falling by 10.053% in scenario S6 compared to pre-sanction levels."

Energy sanctions have a heterogeneous impact on the degree
of carbon reduction in EU member states. The more dependent
member states are on Russian energy; the more their carbon
emissions will fall as energy restrictions come into effect. Among
them, EUhdR countries fell by 4.139% in scenario S6 and EUldR by
only 1.707%. Russia’s carbon emissions, on the other hand, have
continued to rise with the increase in sanctions, with a maximum
increase of 2.406%. This is related to Russia’s adjustment of in-
dustrial output to solve its domestic demand and foreign trade
after trade restrictions. The decline in the world’s carbon emission
level is mainly due to the decrease in carbon emissions in the
European Union, but this downward trend is not sustainable."
"The short-term energy gap has forced the EU to reduce carbon
emissions in ways that limit economic activity and reduce resi-
dents’ energy demand. In solving its energy woes and increasing
the share of renewable energy, the EU may choose a cheaper
but quicker approach: restart coal-fired thermal power plants
that have been phased out. And this phenomenon is happening
in most parts of the European Union. A vital part of the EU’s
energy transition package is using cheap natural gas in Russia."
"Without the support of Russian gas as a transition, it is difficult
to achieve its transition goals by relying on renewable energy
alone. If the energy game between the EU and Russia is not
adequately resolved in the medium and long term, the purposes
of a worldwide climate agreement will not be achieved."
"5. Conclusion
The geopolitical conflict caused by the Russian–Ukrainian war
was not a dispute between the two countries in the first place."
"Through direct war between the two sides and indirect economic
sanctions from the European Union, the world’s major economies
have been directly involved in the vortex of conflict, especially
when the world economy is recovering from the impact of the
epidemic. As the main participants in this geopolitical conflict,
the economic war between the European Union and Russia re-
volves around energy sanctions and countersanctions. This study
analyzes the impact of geopolitical conflicts on the EU, Russia, and
global energy trade. We use the GTAP-E model to quantitatively
evaluate the direct and transfer effects of the EU-Russia energy
game by estimating and setting six scenario assumptions about
the degree of energy trade between the EU and Russia. The
research conclusions are mainly as follows:
1. Energy sanctions triggered by geopolitical conflicts will be
a lose–lose or even multiple losses outcome. By simulating the
different degrees of disruption in energy trade between the EU
and Russia, as the energy game escalates, the economies of both
sides will suffer serious negative shocks. In the scenario of a
complete disruption of energy trade, the macroeconomic loss in
the EU reached 1.488%, the Russian economy reached 4.801%,
and the world economy experienced a decline of 2.895%. Under
the trend of global trade integration, the energy game between
major economies caused by geopolitical conflicts has led to the
reshaping of the world energy trade structure. Energy sanctions
will push up energy prices worldwide and increase the cost of
energy trade between the two sides. It can be seen from the
relative changes in terms of trade and import and export trade
that the terms of trade of both sides of the sanctions will dete-
riorate to varying degrees, with the terms of trade organized by
the EU falling by 2.033% and the decline in Russia’s terms of trade
reaching 5.151%. At the same time, the imports, and exports of the
two major economies will also adjust significantly, with the EU
showing a sharp decline in imports and Russia showing a decline
in exports. From the perspective of economic development, the

economic game between the EU and Russia caused by the Russia-
Ukraine conflict has caused a significant negative impact on the
world economy, resulting in multiple losses."
"2. Geopolitical conflicts will reshape the structure of world
energy trade. As a strategic substance in the era of the industrial
economy, energy is much more critical than other commodities."
"Energy security not only affects economic development but also
is the foundation of social security and stability. By simulating
energy trade between the EU and Russia, the strict implemen-
tation of the energy ban will directly threaten the EU’s energy
security. The energy sanctions between the two sides are divided
by whether to sanction crude oil and crude oil products. Sanctions
on Russian crude oil and crude oil products will directly affect
the energy trade structure of EU member states and cause strong
countermeasures from Russia. After the sanctions on Russian
crude oil and crude oil products, the EU must look for alternatives
to Russian energy worldwide. The more significant phenomenon
is that OPEC, XMN, and ROW account for a substantial increase
in the EU’s energy structure. The calculation of the energy trade
transfer factor also supports this conclusion. At the same time,
after the setback in energy exports to the EU, Russia will turn
its market to countries such as China, India, and the ASEAN
Organization. In the model, both the EU and Russia can reduce the
impact of the energy ban on both sides by rapidly adjusting their
import and export destinations. Still, due to geopolitical games
and high levels of world economic uncertainty, this energy trade
structural adjustment may not have the desired effect in the short
term."
"3. The level of social welfare and ecology should not become
victims of political games. In geopolitical conflicts, the inhabitants
become the bearers of the outcome of political games and wars."
"Russia’s war against Ukraine and the energy ban imposed by the
European Union have caused immeasurable losses to residents."
"The most direct impact of the energy ban on residents of EU
member states is the increase in energy prices. The difference in
the dependence of EU member states on Russian energy has led to
a large difference in the impact of energy bans on residents. In the
S6 situation, the electricity prices of EUhdR, EUmdR and EUldR
increased by 10.12%, 6.95%, and 6.77% respectively, increasing the
cost of electricity prices for residents and causing greater survival
pressure on the residents at the bottom. Energy shortages will
also affect output across sectors in the EU. The direct effect of the
decline in total social output is the loss of residents’ welfare level,
and the indirect effect is the decline in carbon emissions of the
whole society. While carbon emissions will decline in the short
term due to restrictions on economic activity, in the medium to
long term, it will have a profound impact on the world’s energy
transition, and governments may make energy security a strategic
goal and abandon the Sustainable Development Goals."
"4. Reshaping energy trade networks will directly affect the
achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. The terms of
energy trade directly determine the stability of international en-
ergy prices, and energy consumption prices directly affect the
production costs of enterprises. The major countries that have
announced the implementation of the Sustainable Development
Goals have all involved a transformation of their energy con-
sumption structure, based on the basic premise that relatively
cheap and clean natural gas is used as a transitional energy
source. The uncertainty of world energy trade caused by the
energy game directly pushes up energy prices worldwide. In an
economic environment with high energy prices, the fiscal and
monetary policies of governments around the world to promote
sustainable development at the macro level will be greatly re-
duced, while the micro-enterprise level will be driven by its own
interests and risks to reduce investment in green innovation."
"Therefore, carbon emissions from short-term economic down-
turns do not contribute to medium- and long-term sustainable
development."
"This study bridges the gap between geopolitical theory and
energy trade practice. However, this paper, like similar literature,
is limited by the analytical framework of the model and fails to
study the logic between geopolitics, energy trade, and sustainable
development goals at the micro level. This study only studies
the changes in energy games caused by geopolitical conflicts
on economic growth, aggregate output, energy trade diversion
effects, social welfare losses, and carbon emission levels at the
macro level. In the short term, at the cost of economic losses,
the carbon emission target has been exceeded, but a study of the
production level of micro-enterprises shows that the instability
of energy trade has a very negative impact on the medium- and
long-term green transformation of enterprises. Therefore, in the
future, we will conduct a more detailed micro-level study on the
relationship between energy trade and sustainable development
goals, to provide a more complete theoretical and practical basis
for sustainable development."
