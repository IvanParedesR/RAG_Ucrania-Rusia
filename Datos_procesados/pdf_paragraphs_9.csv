This research provides the very first empirical investigation of the impact of the 
Russia-Ukraine war on the cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin trading volume, and returns)."
"The findings indicate that the Russia-Ukraine war impedes Bitcoin trading volume. A 1% 
increase in the Russia-Ukraine war leads to a 0.2% reduction in Bitcoin trading volume."
"The findings also indicate that the impact is more pronounced during the post-invasion 
period, especially after one week of the invasion. Finally, the Russia-Ukraine war predicts 
Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run."
"I. Introduction 
 
 
Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, following 
a prolonged period of military deployment along Ukraine’s 
borders (Boungou & Yatié, 2022). According to Statista, the 
war has resulted in the deaths of 4, 677 civilians and the 
displacement of over 8 million people as of 23 June 2022."
"1 
The conflict has impacted the global economy, food secu­
rity, and geopolitics (Pereira et al., 2022). In the financial 
market, the recent conflict has impacted stock market re­
turns (Boubaker et al., 2022; Boungou & Yatié, 2022), com­
modity market (Appiah-Otoo, 2022), and corporate deci­
sions (Tosun & Eshraghi, 2022). However, it is unknown 
whether the war has had any influence on the cryptocur­
rency market, especially Bitcoin trading volume and re­
turns."
"Cryptocurrencies are appealing to investors since they 
are frequently seen as a “safe haven” investment (Cheng 
& Yen, 2020). Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, 
has piqued the curiosity of investors, the public, and schol­
ars (Kalyvas et al., 2020). Several researchers have recently 
demonstrated how Bitcoin possesses hedging capabilities 
towards economic instability (Mokni et al., 2020), and may 
be used as a hedge and safe haven across currencies (Ka­
lyvas et al., 2020). It could also be used as a hedge amid 
certain market circumstances (Cheng & Yen, 2020). Fur­
thermore, using Bitcoin in investment portfolios has been 
demonstrated to provide significant gains as well as boost 
risk-adjusted outcomes (Brière et al., 2015). To this end, the 
objective of this study is to explore the impact of the ongo­
ing Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading volume and re­
turns. Understanding this link will aid investors and asset 
managers in determining an optimal asset allocation strat­
egy and hedging choices."
"Following Boungou and Yatié (2022), this study first ex­
amines the effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin 
trading volume and finds that the Russia-Ukraine war im­
pedes Bitcoin trading volume. It then examines how Bitcoin 
trading volume responded to the period before the invasion 
(pre-invasion i.e., 23 January to 23 February 2022) and the 
period after the invasion (post-invasion i.e., 24 February to 
16 April 2022), and finds that the impact of the conflict on 
Bitcoin trading volume is more pronounced in the post-in­
vasion period. Furthermore, the study explores whether the 
impact differed during the first week of the invasion (24 
February 2022 to 3 March 2022) and after the first week 
of the invasion (4 March 2022 to 16 April 2022) and finds 
that the impact of the conflict on Bitcoin trading volume 
is greater after the first week of the invasion. Finally, the 
study demonstrates that the Russia-Ukraine war predicts 
Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run."
"The study adds to the growing body of knowledge about 
the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the financial mar­
ket by presenting the very first empirical investigation of 
the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the cryptocurrency 
market. This study also adds to the voluminous literature 
on the determinants of Bitcoin trading volume and returns 
(Mokni et al., 2020; Panagiotidis et al., 2018; Wang et al., 
2022; Wu et al., 2022) by also presenting the impact of the 
Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading volume and returns."

"II. Data and Methodology 
 
 
 
 
A. Data 
 
 
This study examines the impact of the Russia-Ukraine 
war on Bitcoin trading volume and returns. Regarding the 
impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin trading vol­
ume, the study uses panel data of twenty countries
2 with 
dates ranging from 23 January 2022 to 16 April 2022. Al­
though the war began on 24 February 2022, many global 
leaders had long planned for it and felt it was only a matter 
of time until it began (Boungou & Yatié, 2022), therefore 
justifying the study’s start from 23 January 2022. The coun­
tries are also chosen based on the availability of data. Coin 
dance (https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins) serves as 
the source of the Bitcoin trading volume data, while Google 
Trends serves as the source for the Russia-Ukraine war data 
(https://trends.google.com/trends). This study conducts a 
90-day search using the terms “Russia and Ukraine and 
war”. The first differences of the natural logarithm of Bit­
coin prices are used to generate the time-series data on 
Bitcoin returns. Except for Bitcoin returns, we log-trans­
form all the variables to show the results as elasticities and 
to provide efficient outcomes (Appiah-Otoo, Song, et al., 
2022)."
"B. Methodology 
 
 
To examine the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on 
Bitcoin trading volume, the study estimates the following 
model: 
where 
 denotes Bitcoin trading volume; 
 de­
notes the Russia-Ukraine war; and  represents the error 
term. Country and time are represented by  and  We ex­
pect  to be positive and statistically significant. This is 
because Bitcoin possesses hedging capabilities toward eco­
nomic instability (Mokni et al., 2020)."
We estimate Equation (1) using the IV-GMM method.
"This method is suitable for the estimation of Equation (1) 
given the small period, a large number of countries, omit­
ted variables, and the issues of endogeneity (Appiah-Otoo, 
Acheampong, et al., 2022; Appiah-Otoo & Song, 2021). We 
also use the fixed effects (FE) method for robustness test­
ing. This method also addresses country-specific fixed ef­
fects issues."
"To also scrutinise the influence of the Russia-Ukraine 
war on Bitcoin returns, we use a quantile regression. Quan­
tile regression has the advantage of estimating conditional 
average performance models using numerous additional 
conditional quantile functions (Zeinedini et al., 2022)."
"Quantile regression can also produce an additional all-in­
clusive numerical examination of the randomized connec­
tions amid regressors (Koenker & Hallock, 2001)."
"The model is stated as follows: 
where 
 signifies Bitcoin returns 
 
 is the natural log­
arithm of the Russia-Ukraine war 
 and  indicates 
the error term. Time is denoted by t;  is the constant term, 
while  is the quantile 
 of the conditional distri­
bution."
"III. Results and discussion 
 
 
 
 
This section presents the results. Table 1 shows the re­
sults on the effect of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin 
trading volume. The full sample period results based on the 
IV-GMM and FE techniques show that the war impedes Bit­
coin trading volume. A 1% rise in the Russia-Ukraine war 
leads to a 0.247% reduction in Bitcoin trading volume ac­
cording to the IV-GMM estimates, while a 1% rise in the 
Russia-Ukraine war leads to a 0.784% reduction in Bit­
coin trading volume according to the FE estimates. Thus, 
Bitcoin trading volume remains sensitive to the Russia-
Ukraine war. This conflicts with our expectations but aligns 
with previous studies that document uncertainties to im­
pede Bitcoin growth (Mokni et al., 2020). Thus, Bitcoin re­
mains a speculative asset."
"Turning to the pre- and post-invasion periods, the IV-
GMM estimates indicate that the war has a negative effect 
on Bitcoin trading volume in both periods; however, the 
negative effect is only significant in the post-invasion pe­
riod. The pre-invasion findings are collaborated by the FE 
estimates, albeit statistically significant, while the post-in­
vasion findings remained contradictory. These differences 
could be attributed to the fact that the IV-GMM technique 
resolves endogeneity issues, while the FE does not."
"Moving to the weeks of the invasion results in Table 2, 
we observe that the Russia-Ukraine war has a negative and 
statistically significant impact on Bitcoin trading volume 
only after the first week of the invasion, based on the IV-
GMM technique."
"Table 3 shows the Bitcoin returns results. The Russia-
Ukraine war has a positive and statistically significant effect 
on Bitcoin returns in the 20th quantile, while it has a neg­
ative and statistically significant effect on Bitcoin returns 
in the 70th quantile. Thus, the Russia-Ukraine war predicts 
Bitcoin returns in both the short and long run. Thus, in­
vestors should take into consideration the Russia-Ukraine 
war when allocating assets and designing hedging strate­
gies in the Bitcoin market. Also, policymakers should devise 
strategies to help combat the adverse impact of the Russia-
Ukraine war on the Bitcoin market."
"Figure 1 displays a plot of the quantile regression results 
for the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on Bitcoin returns."
"The figure shows that the Russia-Ukraine war has a neg­
ative effect on Bitcoin returns on average across all the 
quantiles."

"IV. Conclusion 
 
 
This study examines the impact of the Russia-Ukraine 
war on the cryptocurrency market (Bitcoin trading volume 
and returns). The findings indicate that the Russia-Ukraine 
war impedes Bitcoin trading volume. The findings also in­
dicate that the impact is more pronounced during the post-
invasion period, especially after one week of the invasion."
"Finally, the Russia-Ukraine war impedes Bitcoin returns in 
the long-run 
This study focuses only on Bitcoin given its popularity 
and dominance. Future studies should use alternative cryp­
tocurrencies to re-estimate these associations. Future stud­
ies should also explore the causal association between the 
Russia-Ukraine war and Bitcoin trading volume and re­
turns. Finally, a more recent dataset can be employed to 
validate these findings."
