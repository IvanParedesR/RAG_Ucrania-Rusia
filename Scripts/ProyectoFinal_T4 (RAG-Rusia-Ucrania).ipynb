      "1. Introduction The Russian invasion of Ukraine has caused considerable human suering and harmed global trade (Ruta 2022). According to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the global economic outlook has worsened since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on February 24, 2022, with trade growth pro- jected to fall from 4.7% to less than 3.4% (WTO 2022). Ukraine and Russia are major commodity exporters. Ukraine, in particular, ships most of its products by sea, and the conict has greatly limited this mode of transport. Russia, in contrast, faces substantial economic sanctions that im- pact the domestic economy and limits its ability to participate in global markets. Both mechanisms led to a worldwide reallocation of trade ows for commodities, such as base metals, mineral oils, and agricultural products (Borin et al. 2022; Bentley et al. 2022). This paper provides the rst ex-post empirical analysis of the global trade reallocation eects caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, using detailed trade data and theory-consistent empirical models to quantify the degree of trade destruction and diversion resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n",

Most recently, policy makers  have been promoting energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of en ergy production, which is in line with the green goals of a transition  away from fossil fuels to arrest climate change. However, such goals may  become more elusive if policy makers rank energy security and  affordability higher in their agenda. On the food market front, produc tion shortfalls, trade disruptions and increased input costs raise com modity prices, most notably wheat. Ukrainian wheat exports, that  account for nearly 10% of global exports, ceased after the closure of  Ukrainian Black Sea ports. Exporting wheat overland is more expensive  than by sea (World Bank, 2022a). Rising food prices and disruptions to  trade pose risks to the coherence of the society. Besides, food security  ranks high on the policy makers' agendas; thus necessitating interna tional cooperation on these issues. With regard to metal markets, our  results show that nickel has been heavily affected. Russia accounts for  20% of high-grade nickel used in batteries. Sanctions have disrupted  supply from Russia's mining giant Nornickel. The production of  stainless steel, which accounts for 70% of nickel consumption is slowing,  mainly in China (World Bank, 2022a).

      "A growing literature investigates the economic consequences of the Russia-Ukraine war. Studies have examined a range of topics, including economic growth (Mahlstein et al. 2022), stock market performance (Boungou and Yati e 2022), commodity markets (Fang and Shao 2022), and food security (Behnassi and El Haiba 2022; Carriquiry et al. 2022). Borin et al. (2022) developed a theoretical model to show that the extent of the economic eects depends on the ability of a country to diversify its supply chains. Ruta (2022) conducted an ex-ante simulation that predicts global trade to decrease by 1% in 2022, reducing the global gross domestic product by 0.7%. Other ex-ante studies have simulated the implications of economic sanctions on trade (Allen 2022; Estrada and Koutronas 2022), analyzed pre-war grain market trade dependencies (Glauben et al. 2022), and explored measures to ensure food security (Bentley et al. 2022). In an ex-post analysis for grain and oilseed trade, Ahn et al. (2023) nd that imports from Ukraine were 78.2% lower between February and July 2022. They show that the Ukraine-Russia war had substantial trade implications for the directly involved countries but only limited ones for global grain and oilseed markets.\n",

      "The Russia-Ukraine War and Global Trade Reallocations Sandro Steinbach Abstract This paper uses a product-level empirical model of bilateral trade to examine the global trade implications of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The results show that imports from Ukraine were 47.3% below the counterfactual between February and August 2022. The Russia-Ukraine war led to signicant trade diversion for Russia, primarily beneting Russian mineral oil and gas exports to Europe and Asia. The analysis also reveals that the trade adjustments operate mainly through import price hikes, with notable heterogeneity across product groups and regions. The ndings indicate that the Ukraine-Russia war had signicant trade implications for Ukraine and Russia but only limited ones for other countries.\n",

      "Our research has several implications for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers when  designing effective financial strategies by showing the close relationship between war,  geopolitical risk, the banking sector, the energy sector and the stability of the whole financial  system. First, Ukraine  Russia war has a significant implication for oil prices and exchange  rates during the uncertain period, especially in the long term. As discussed above, we find that  fluctuations in energy prices and exchange rates are two serious consequences of the war that  could significantly impact market expectations for bank stocks, a proxy for the perceived  soundness of the financial system. The findings reveal that since the beginning of the war, bank  stocks have been highly susceptible to oil supply shocks that worsen inflation or exchange rate  risks. This vulnerability could substantially impact the effectiveness of macroeconomic  policies designed to curb inflation and stabilize financial markets. Observing the market's  reaction to the war's consequences might be instructive for the financial system's risk  management. Second, this paper also highlights the effect of oil-dependent of European  countries on Russia during the uncertain time, addressing a need for less the EU's dependence  on imported fossil fuels and more actions for affordable, secure energy. Third, the Ukraine- Russia war and its related sanctions also point out the need to consider business cycle  implications of political disruptions and the possible damage to trade relationships between  countries in general and banks in particular.\n",

      "The paper makes two distinct contributions to the growing literature on the economic consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Firstly, it is the rst study to utilize counterfactual statistical methods to quantify the direct and indirect impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war on international trade. These ndings extend previous ex-ante studies on the trade eects of economic sanctions and trade blockages and ex-post studies on the product-specic trade eects (Allen 2022; Estrada and Koutronas 2022; Ahn et al. 2023). Secondly, the paper documents the global reallocation dynamics for dierent product groups and regions. It shows how the trade eects of the Russia-Ukraine war operate primarily through import price adjustments. These insights are essential, as earlier ex- ante simulation studies have warned of supply constraints and their implications for global markets (Bentley et al. 2022; Glauben et al. 2022; Ruta 2022).\n",

The toll of war on Ukraine,  on those still in Ukraine, and on those who have left the country has yet  to be fully understood. What is clear from our research is that those who  have arrived in Poland and Germany are both fortunate to have escaped  immediate danger, and are confronting tremendous personal, profes sional, financial and familial challenges. A 28-year old woman from  Kryvyi Rih explained during an interview in Poland:  I am very worried about what may happen not only to the city but  also to my parents. Now I am worried because me and my child are  safe, but my parents and friends are not. Almost all my friends, co-  workers, and everyone I communicated with stayed in Ukraine. I  have a guilty conscience that they are there, and I am here.\n",

Applying a Markov-switching  HAR model on volatility proxies, estimates are made of synchronization, duration and intensity measures for  each event. In broad terms, stock markets and commodities respond most rapidly to the Russian invasion; and  post-invasion crisis intensity is noticeably smaller compared to both the Covid-19 and the GFC. Wheat and nickel  are the most affected commodities due to the prominent exporter status of the two countries.\n",

      "Our research has several implications for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers when  designing effective financial strategies by showing the close relationship between war,  geopolitical risk, the banking sector, the energy sector and the stability of the whole financial  system. First, Ukraine  Russia war has a significant implication for oil prices and exchange  rates during the uncertain period, especially in the long term. As discussed above, we find that  fluctuations in energy prices and exchange rates are two serious consequences of the war that  could significantly impact market expectations for bank stocks, a proxy for the perceived  soundness of the financial system. The findings reveal that since the beginning of the war, bank  stocks have been highly susceptible to oil supply shocks that worsen inflation or exchange rate  risks. This vulnerability could substantially impact the effectiveness of macroeconomic  policies designed to curb inflation and stabilize financial markets. Observing the market's  reaction to the war's consequences might be instructive for the financial system's risk  management. Second, this paper also highlights the effect of oil-dependent of European  countries on Russia during the uncertain time, addressing a need for less the EU's dependence  on imported fossil fuels and more actions for affordable, secure energy. Third, the Ukraine- Russia war and its related sanctions also point out the need to consider business cycle  implications of political disruptions and the possible damage to trade relationships between  countries in general and banks in particular.\n",

      "2    1. Introduction  The Russia-Ukraine war1 has heightened global financial stability risks2 (ECB, 2022) as it  harmfully and virtually affects all aspects of economic activities and financing conditions (e.g.,  energy prices, inflation, economic growth). The situation has worsened in the European  countries since the war, and related sanctions further put more pressure on energy and  commodity prices3. As this region relies heavily on the Russian energy supply, which accounts  for approximately 43% of its natural gas and 27% of its crude oil imports in 2020, European  financial stability is severely harmed by this rising inflation. Correspondingly, banks and  creditors are now tightening their financing conditions, making them struggle with the  increasingly indebted firms due to Covid19 and lowering their own revenue and profits. The  banking sector, especially in Europe, has therefore faced weaker profitability (ECB, 2022). In  the US, BNY Mellon had a drop of 3% in fee revenue (equivalent to $3.2 billion) in the first  quarter of 2022, and $88 million of this loss is caused by the sanctions against Russia4. Those  banks inescapably confront an increasingly uncertain environment caused by the war, the  volatile markets, and persistently higher inflations across countries.\n",

      "Western nations had threatened Russia with sanctions if the war materializes. These sanctions  are anticipated to significantly impact numerous European banks conducting international  banking activities related to Russia. In addition, war and sanctions increase concerns of  disruptions in international trade, escalating commodity prices, and increasing financial  instability. These factors potentially influence the future cash flow and risk of banks. The  reaction of the market to bank stocks is not limited to Europe. Oceania and Asia also  experienced a sharp drop in bank stocks' returns on the first day of the war. North American  bank stocks showed a noticeable but weakest reaction across the region. South America and  Africa also saw marked declines in bank stocks' performance on the day of the war. In general,  bank stocks on the six continents all saw steep decreases on the day of the war. These losses  are extreme compared to the trend of fluctuations over the preceding year. This suggests that  the Russia-Ukraine war considerably impacts investor sentiment towards bank stocks. This  impact has a worldwide scope and is strongest in the European region.\n",

Rising energy revenues are unlikely to  counteract the economic repercussions of the global pull out from  Russia. This may prove the greatest hit to the global economy since the  Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008; and it may exceed the impact of  Covid-19 given the prominent exporter status of the two countries.\n",

Considering the energy trade structure of the two economies and the EUs energy sanctions, this article sets up six short-term scenarios, as shown in Table 2. From the perspective of the energy trade structure of the two major economies, the EU is highly dependent on Russian energy imports. In Russias trade structure, energy exports are the backbone of its economy. To sanction Russia for waging war in Ukraine, the EU has reduced or banned imports of Russian energy goods to combat its economy. In the scenario S1 setup, we set the EU to voluntarily cut off coal imports from Russia following the EUs Fifth package of sanctions proposed on April 8, 2022.\n",

      "The EU continues escalating energy sanctions against Russia, covering crude and crude oil products. Implementing these sanc- tions will have a non-negligible impact on the EUs short-term energy security and even lead to differences within the EU on sanctions against Russia. In scenario S4, energy trade between the EU and Russia would fall by 81.69%, and if Russia countersanc- tions against the EU by reducing gas supplies (S5), energy trade between the two would fall by 90.68%. The transfer effect map of energy trade shows that the imposition of severe sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products will significantly change the EUs energy structure. Russias share of the EUs energy mix is rapidly declining. The EU can only fill the gap in the energy market by increasing energy imports from other energy supply organizations. Russia will transfer exports to the EU through third-party channels, such as the Eurasian Economic Union. And Russia is also actively developing new energy exporters, such as India, China, and other non-Western world countries. In the process of EU sanctions against Russia, Russias foreign energy trade exports fell from 2.267% in the S1 scenario to 22.818% in the S6 scenario, which played a role in the sanctions against the Russian energy economy. In the simulation, other energy exporters can supplement the EUs energy demand. The total energy supply situation may be worse than the model scenario, so whether the EU will continue to impose energy sanctions on Russia will be decided based on the actual energy supply scenario.\n",

How will sanctions and countersanctions on energy trade affect the EU-Russia and the worlds energy trade pattern? This paper sets six energy trade scenarios based on the degree of energy sanctions and counter- sanction measures imposed by the EU and Russia. We use the global multi-region comparative static CGE model to simulate the changes in macroeconomic indicators in major countries worldwide. The diversion effect of energy trade and the impact on the national economy caused by geographical risks quantitatively analyzes. The results show: (1) Energy sanctions will cause economic damage to both sides, in the worst-case scenario, the EU economic loss reaches 1.488%, the Russian loss reaches 4.8%, and worldwide inflation will rise; (2) Russias counter-sanctions will have a direct economic impact on the EU, but will not improve its economic situation; (3) Energy sanctions will bring about a direct energy trade transfer effect, the EUs energy imports will be diverted to non-Russian markets, and Russian energy exports will also shift to Asian markets, and energy trade between the two economies will be significantly reduced; (4) Energy supply will have a profound impact on the worlds economy and society, leading to social instability and a decline in total output of 2.895%. Energy games will have a negative impact on the worlds carbon emission reduction and energy consumption structure transformation. Through quantitative analysis of the impact of energy sanctions on the world economy and society, the energy game caused by the geopolitical crisis will harm both parties involved in the game and the world economy. The world pattern will return from the development pattern of cooperative division of labor to a situation of conflict and confrontation, which is not conducive to the transformation of energy trade and consumption structure under market rules.\n",

      "4. Results and discussion 4.1. Direct effects of energy sanctions 4.1.1. GDP and GDP deflator Table 3 shows the real GDP and GDP deflator changes in the EU regions, Russia, and corresponding world regions. A complete cessation of energy trade between the EU and Russia would lead to a 2.895% drop in world GDP. The shock results of different scenarios show that the impact on economies of whether or not to embargo oil and petroleum products varies widely. When the EU bans Russian coal in scenario S1, the economic damage to the EU is up to 0.099% and 0.891% to Russia. Russias counter- sanctions measures can blow the EU economy, but they cannot improve the economic losses caused by sanctions. Once the EU imposes sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, the economic losses to both sides will skyrocket. In the scenario of a hard decoupling of energy trade between the two sides (S6), the economic losses of the EU consortium would reach 1.488%, while the GDP losses of Russia would get 4.8%. In the game between the two sides, there is no economic winner, and the sanctions of both sides will cause economic damage to the other, but the economic losses for Russia will be higher. At the same time, other participants in this event, such as the members of the G7 group, have been less affected in the energy game between the EU and Russia (such as the United Kingdom, the highest loss is only 0.0712%), or even benefited. For example, the United States has maintained positive economic growth. As the game between the two sides intensifies, its economic growth degree has increased, reaching a maximum of 0.1165%.\n",

      "From the perspective of the impact of energy sanctions on the import and export trade of the two sides, both sanctions and countersanctions significantly impact the import and export trade of the two sides, mainly on exports for Russia and imports for EU member states. Implementing sanctions on energy im- ports by EU member states will directly reduce the total energy imports of the EU, which will reduce the total EU imports. In the simulation, total EU imports fell the most at S6, reaching 2.404%, shown in Table 7. Considering the practical dilemma of the EU in adjusting the energy trade structure in the short term, energy import restrictions will become the most significant hidden danger to the EUs energy security. The energy ban has an even more substantial impact on Russias import and export trade, with total imports falling by 6.23% and exports by 8.56% in the S6 scenario. According to the policy simulation results, EEU, an economic cooperation alliance led by Russia, has seen a significant increase in its import and export volume during the sanctions period. In the S6 scenario, EEU imports increased by 5.82%, and exports increased by 5.32%. Russia can transfer energy trade through the EEU and other countries. Although there is a change, the import and export of the rest of the worlds nations are insignificant.\n",

      "Energy security not only affects economic development but also is the foundation of social security and stability. By simulating energy trade between the EU and Russia, the strict implemen- tation of the energy ban will directly threaten the EUs energy security. The energy sanctions between the two sides are divided by whether to sanction crude oil and crude oil products. Sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products will directly affect the energy trade structure of EU member states and cause strong countermeasures from Russia. After the sanctions on Russian crude oil and crude oil products, the EU must look for alternatives to Russian energy worldwide. The more significant phenomenon is that OPEC, XMN, and ROW account for a substantial increase in the EUs energy structure. The calculation of the energy trade transfer factor also supports this conclusion. At the same time, after the setback in energy exports to the EU, Russia will turn its market to countries such as China, India, and the ASEAN Organization. In the model, both the EU and Russia can reduce the impact of the energy ban on both sides by rapidly adjusting their import and export destinations. Still, due to geopolitical games and high levels of world economic uncertainty, this energy trade structural adjustment may not have the desired effect in the short term.\n",

      "The sanctions imposed on Russia for its military intervention in Ukraine include individual, economic, and financial sanctions. These sanctions are aimed at weakening Russia's economy, making it unable to sustain its high military spending, and ultimately forcing Russia to withdraw from Ukraine. Specifically, there have been sanctions on Russia's energy trade, with the EU being highly dependent on Russian energy imports. Additionally, there have been measures such as reducing gas exports to the EU by 30% and potentially even 50% in retaliation for various EU sanctions. The sanctions have had direct effects on the GDP and GDP deflator of the EU regions and Russia, with a complete cessation of energy trade between the EU and Russia leading to a 2.895% drop in world GDP.\n"

However, the detailed  influence degree, key weak points and influence process is still unclear in the current. Therefore, this study  established a newly improved under-load cascading failure model with consideration of overload limitation, and  used it to evaluate influence of Russian- Ukraine War on the global energy and food security. This study also  proposed a method to assess the network structure characteristic including robustness and resilience through  model simulation under different scenarios. The main results include: The upper limitation of node load has the  dominant function on the global energy and food security, while the influence of lower limitation parameter of  node load has limited function. All of the networks have relative consistent recover and anti-damage ability  against Russian and Ukraine War and the global panic except barley network. A key phenomenon we should  concern is that the largest trade flow amounts are not occurred in the failure nodes. The failure nodes are always  the countries with low economic scale and political status. The results tell us that we should further strengthen  the importance of enhance production ability and energy types to resist the risk of Russian and Ukraine War. The  global international organizations are also required to strengthen the function of balance the global security  demand of energy and food between big countries and small countries.

      "Our research has several implications for investors, portfolio managers and policymakers when  designing effective financial strategies by showing the close relationship between war,  geopolitical risk, the banking sector, the energy sector and the stability of the whole financial  system. First, Ukraine  Russia war has a significant implication for oil prices and exchange  rates during the uncertain period, especially in the long term. As discussed above, we find that  fluctuations in energy prices and exchange rates are two serious consequences of the war that  could significantly impact market expectations for bank stocks, a proxy for the perceived  soundness of the financial system. The findings reveal that since the beginning of the war, bank  stocks have been highly susceptible to oil supply shocks that worsen inflation or exchange rate  risks. This vulnerability could substantially impact the effectiveness of macroeconomic  policies designed to curb inflation and stabilize financial markets. Observing the market's  reaction to the war's consequences might be instructive for the financial system's risk  management. Second, this paper also highlights the effect of oil-dependent of European  countries on Russia during the uncertain time, addressing a need for less the EU's dependence  on imported fossil fuels and more actions for affordable, secure energy. Third, the Ukraine- Russia war and its related sanctions also point out the need to consider business cycle  implications of political disruptions and the possible damage to trade relationships between  countries in general and banks in particular.\n",

      "The paper contributes to the fast-emerging literature on the impact of  the Russian-Ukrainian war upon economic and financial outcomes. Our  results show an instantaneous reaction of world stock markets to the  Russian-Ukrainian war. This suggests that the invasion was interpreted  as real news by investors. The timeliness of the response is unlike that  of either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where a lag of up to seven days  is evidenced. The crisis duration metrics, however, suggest that the  severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has been muted compared to  either the GFC or the Covid-19. We attribute this to an expectation that  the war would not be prolonged. Moreover, it is possible that investors  mis-interpret this event.

      "The paper contributes to the fast-emerging literature on the impact of  the Russian-Ukrainian war upon economic and financial outcomes. Our  results show an instantaneous reaction of world stock markets to the  Russian-Ukrainian war. This suggests that the invasion was interpreted  as real news by investors. The timeliness of the response is unlike that  of either the GFC or the Covid-19 crises, where a lag of up to seven days  is evidenced. The crisis duration metrics, however, suggest that the  severity of the Russian-Ukrainian war has been muted compared to  either the GFC or the Covid-19. We attribute this to an expectation that  the war would not be prolonged. Moreover, it is possible that investors  mis-interpret this event.

The study highlights the need to strengthen production ability and energy types to resist the risks posed by the war. Zhou emphasizes the importance of balancing global security demands for energy and food between larger and smaller countries, particularly in Africa and Asia, to mitigate the risks associated with the conflict.\n"
